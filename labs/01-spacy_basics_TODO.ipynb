there have been no reports of blight and the exceptionally bitter winter of 2011-12 was followed this year by a milder one, creating expectations of a large crop.\n","\n","\n","\n","The increase has come despite a marked improvement in Afghanistan's specialised counter-narcotics units, Lemahieu said.\n","Fear of eradication has become a far more significant reason for farmers to stick to legal crops than in the past, the report found.\n","\n","\n","\n","But overall the government and aid community has not prioritised efforts to cut back a crop and trade that feeds global markets for heroin, Lemahieu said, despite its corrosive effect on security, corruption and trust in Kabul.\n","\n","\n","Typical of the official neglect are the 22 \"national priority programmes\" drawn up by Kabul to focus aid money and diplomatic efforts on its key development concerns including justice and education.\n","Counter-narcotics was not one of them, nor has it been put at the heart of the other programmes.\n","\n","\n","\"We need to have counter-narcotics dealt with seriously by the entire government as well as the aid community,\" Lemahieu said.\n","\"One of the big missing links here is providing for the communities themselves.\"\n","\n","\n","Eradication programmes that do not provide farmers with benefits such as healthcare and education, and support growing other crops will just push the Taliban or other insurgent groups that do tolerate or encourage poppy production, he added.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<span class=\"tex2jax_ignore\"><div class=\"entities\" style=\"line-height: 2.5;
