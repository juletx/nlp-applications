# NLP Applications I: Text Classification, Sequence Labeling, Opinion Mining and Question Answering

## Objectives

- To develop NLP applications using existing ready-to-use tools
- To analyze the interdisciplinarity involved in developing NLP applications

The objective of this course is to introduce the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the most used applications both in academia and the industry. The course contents will include basic techniques of NLP: document classification, sequence labeling for opinion mining, vector-based word representations (embeddings), and normalization and pre-processing of texts. The course will have a practical focus based on laboratories and practical tasks learning to use NLP tools based on machine and deep learning.
