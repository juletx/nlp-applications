negative	After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . 
negative	A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement . 
negative	The manager continually interrupted with `` Is there anything else I can do for you ? '' , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . 
negative	She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .
