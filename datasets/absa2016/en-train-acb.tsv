__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Avoid this place!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#PRICES	The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Food was okay, nothing great.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I/we will never go back to this place again.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Can't wait wait for my next visit.
-	I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.' 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
-	Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
-	We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
-	What's the difference between the two?
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service- friendly and attentive.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
-	i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.
-	(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..) 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	the food is decent.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
-	I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I'm going back.
-	Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
-	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I will be going back and heartily recommend it!

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
-	Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Go hungry and enjoy.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
-	Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
-	I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	IT WAS HORRIBLE.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
-	I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	A big disappointment, all around.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.

__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.

__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
-	When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
-	I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But they do.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 
-	If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This restaurant was way overhyped.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I definitely wouldn't go back.
-	There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Salads were fantastic.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We will be back.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
-	It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They have it all -- great price, food, and service.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	it is not consistent.
-	really depends on your luck!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
-	Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
-	For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The filet mignon dish was superb!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It's a small cute restaurant.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I absolutely love this place!!!
-	From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
-	I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The sushi is amazing!!! 
__label__FOOD#PRICES	And amazingly cheap.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Big thumbs up!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Very affordable and excellent ambient!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We were very disappointed.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
-	Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Check this place out!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#PRICES	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#PRICES	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.
-	To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Fish was overdone.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It is simply amazing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.

-	P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
-	LOL

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Beautiful experience.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The staff offers impeccable service.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.

-	I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It was divine melts in your mouth.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!!

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
-	People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
-	Recommendations, of course, are required!
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	No plans to return anytime soon.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This place is so much fun.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
-	This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
-	I think the stuff was better than Disney.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Our food was great too!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	And really large portions.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We will go back every time we are in the City.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The place is a lot of fun.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	My six year old loved it.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food however, is what one might expect.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We had a good time.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.

-	Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
-	Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
-	It's popular w/the late crowd.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Overall, not worth the money.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
-	Went to Village last night for my birthday.
-	We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We were very pleasantly surprised.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
-	Why?
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	please don't fool us.
-	I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Of course, it is crowded but who cares.

__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Pizza here is consistently good.

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
-	The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Never again!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I absolutely Loved this place.
-	My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good.

__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	But, they were too big for the bun.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
__label__FOOD#PRICES	Also they were $15 each!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.

-	We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
-	As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.
-	Our friends have not arrived yet.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
-	I've been here twice now.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They charge different prices all the time.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	NO PIZZA 33 for me!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.

__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service is awful.

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Good, fast service.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I would highly recommend.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	Food is great and inexpensive.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	The location is perfect.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Give it a try and enjoy.

-	Jimmy is Dominican!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
__label__DRINKS#PRICES __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Would NEVER go back there.
-	Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
-	That place was awesome,,,  sally !
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Always busy but fast moving.

__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	What more can you ask for?
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
-	Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Everything about this restaurant was special.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The flavors robust and subtle.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I'm saving up for my next visit.
-	I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The place was quiet and delightful.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Service was good and food is wonderful.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#PRICES __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	You can't go wrong with this place.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I LOVE their Thai
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
-	I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I will go back to Suan soon!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
-	This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I wish they would change back to what it was before.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food now is inconsistent.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The setting is casual and romantic.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Prices are very good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is excellent! 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
-	(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
-	(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.
-	After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was pleasantly suprised.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was exceptional.
-	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.
-	i would just ask for no oil next time.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The fried dumplings are GREAT!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Never fails to please.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES	Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service is fast and friendly.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But that is highly forgivable.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
-	I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	You must try the shrimp appetizers.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
-	I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
-	Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
-	Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
-	The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was absolutely amazing!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Dessert is a joke...dont bother
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Fantastic place.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Cute and decorative.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	A pleasant surprise.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Wonderful at holiday time.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	A real dissapointment.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Priced at upper intermediate range.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I really liked this place.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Probably would not go again...

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It just wasn't Thai.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	No thanks!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We were then shooed inside.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We left, never to return.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
-	Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__LOCATION#GENERAL	Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pizza was pretty good and huge.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.

__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Don't get me started on the margaritas, either.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
-	Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.

-	During our trip to NYC, we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu (offering a modified menu for $65 pp).
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing.

-	I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
-	Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.
-	A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes, Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world, but it's pretty good, albeit with a somewhat dismal setting.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Unhygienic
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I do not recommend.
-	I went there 2times .
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Great place, great value.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	It's a great place to order from or sit-in.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Awesome
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Try it!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Very pleased
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Good creative rolls!
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The appetizers are also delicious!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Amazing food.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Mazing interior.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great food!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
-	Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $29/per person including sake but it is $55 per person not including sake.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Indo Chinese food, pretty good...
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Still we keep going back :)
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I was speechless by the horrible food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
-	Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	This place survives on reputation alone.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I will NEVER return.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Best In ALL of NYC
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn...
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way...
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
-	I'm telling you...
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	you should travel from the Bronx to try it...
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__LOCATION#GENERAL	great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	so delicious!!!!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Patsy's Pizza = true love
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
-	My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.
-	Need I say more?
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	great hot dogs..
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	great taste
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great, original taste.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#PRICES	Helpful service and average price per dish $10.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	great food
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	This place has great indian chinese food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!
-	I have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I came across Village Underground by accident, now I go there all the time.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#PRICES	The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Highly recommended!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Everything on the menu is great. 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This establishment is the real deal. 
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
-	There is "Expensive-but-worth-it" and there is "Expensive-and-WTF"?
-	This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.
__label__FOOD#PRICES	But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
-	Are you freaking kidding me?
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Look, the appetizers were really good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The entree was also very good.
__label__FOOD#PRICES	Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
-	$500 included:
-	Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each.
-	Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
-	A beef Consomme.
-	Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Vanison was good but not amazing.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Bison was quite excellent however.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Dessert: pure disaster.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Just not good at all.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
-	I was wrong.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
-	Yes, it is good, but I've had better for cheaper.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
-	BUT not in a good way.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
-	We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The place is beautiful!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The hostess was very pleasant.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#PRICES	However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!
-	Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Our experience did not ever get any better.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We asked for beverages and never received them.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I wish I COULD be refunded!
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
-	I went here for a family birthday dinner. 
-	Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening. 
-	The hostess said "Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which I replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please." 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions. 
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. 
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. 
-	After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member. 
-	The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order. 
-	We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." 
-	We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good. 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service not the friendliest to our "large party"! 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Probably would not go back here.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great Indian food
-	I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	One of the BEST
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
-	My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
-	We go often for lunch and the place is packed.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Wretched and retching
-	This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
-	They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
-	Fine, I wont hang you for that.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
-	Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	None was made so i hung up.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.
-	Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!
-	We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Eat at your own risk.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
-	I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	More Williamsburg Garbage
-	My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight.
-	We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.
__label__FOOD#PRICES	Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
-	I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	She just nodded and walked off.
-	There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We were charged full price.
-	If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village.
-	Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Lives up to the hype
-	We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It was well worth the wait.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The wife had the risotto which was amazing.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!
-	I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
-	Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.
-	The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Terrible would be a compliment!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.
-	We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Stay away
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great Shabu Shabu
-	I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I love it.
-	To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
-	In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	Restaurant with a view
-	Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food tasted very good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The family seafood entree was very good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The main entree was also very good.
-	We order a bit of everything on the menu.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This place doesn't make any sense
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
-	Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Good Food
-	I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
-	I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible)
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Loved it
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere was great.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.
-	Maybe it has improved since then?
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Dumbfoundingly Poor
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Polite acknowledgement is out;
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	supercilious scorn is in.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	On that scale, it's a world-beater.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	How is this palce still open?
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I honestly don't even know where to begin.
-	My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.
-	We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Everything was going good until we got our meals.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
-	My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
-	I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
-	I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
-	We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The level of rudeness was preposterous.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	cirspy crust margherita pizza
-	we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	it was really good pizza.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
-	Moving on.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
-	Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Well...they can run but they can't hide.
-	I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.
-	Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
-	However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This place...god where do i begin.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great Hot Dogs!
-	I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
__label__FOOD#PRICES	Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
-	We live nearby BFC. 
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"
-	My family ate here last weekend.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	If you go here, do it on his off-night.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Best meal in a long time!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The food is great and the environment is even better.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Everyone must come here at least once.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Highly recommend it!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great Atmosphere
-	Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Poor service and management
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Don’t go to this place!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Appetizers took nearly an hour.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	What a hassle!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is very good, but not outstanding.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
-	Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Expensive
-	I went there after hearing how great it was.
-	Wow.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
-	I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	So rude!!!
-	I went with JWILS.
-	Her review is above.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
-	My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."
-	What?
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	bad staff
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I generally like this place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is good.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The design of the space is good.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But the service is HORRID!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
