__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Yum!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Serves really good sushi.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Not the biggest portions but adequate.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Green Tea creme brulee is a must!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Don't leave the restaurant without it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	No Comparison
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I can't say enough about this place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	It has great sushi and even better service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Snotty Attitude
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Good food!
-	– We love breakfast food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	This is a great place to get a delicious meal.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We never had to wait more than 5 minutes.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The staff is pretty friendly.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The onion rings are great!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	They are not greasy or anything.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Overrated
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.
-	The prices are outrageous, especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I will not go back.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Worst Service I Ever Had
-	– A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I complained to the manager, but he was not even apologetic.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I will never return again.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Fabulous Italian Food!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I highly recommend Mioposto.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I love this restaurant
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	– I will never forget the amazing meal, service, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It was absolutely amazing.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse, the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I have not a bad thing to say about this place.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	AMAZING.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Mmm... good!
-	– Went there last night with a friend.
-	She had heard from a co-worker about this place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was great!
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the food.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We're going back. :D
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Caution - its real food for people who love the best.
-	Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies (like me) so if your not a foodie (nothing wrong with that)- head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it!
-	If your looking for real quality  (not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings - which allegedly recently got in trouble for "adjusting" ratings), you need to get in here!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Very Disappointing
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed!!!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Nothing really came across as outstanding.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Very disappointed.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	However, the value and service are both severely lacking.
-	Portions contain less fish than one would expect, particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC (Masa excluded, of course).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service ranges from mediocre to offensive.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.
-	But Im sure this was just an honest mistake...
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their apps are all delicious.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But the space is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	You are bound to have a very charming time.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Not recommanded!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	– The food was not great & the waiters were rude.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	great service
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__LOCATION#GENERAL	– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	my service was stellar!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	the food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I don't know if I'll be back....
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Best Sushi in town.
-	Have gone to all the top places.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Everything you want and more, very fresh.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The best calamari in Seattle!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– By far the best bar in the east village...
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Every time "0-sixtynine" is called the bartender buys everyone drinks!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Been there lots since and its always a good time.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!
-	– Where can I begin.
-	I can't!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Just go there and see for yourself.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	You need to watch your game, they will have it on for you.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	And the upstairs is a great place to hang out.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Kudos to these guys.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.
-	Thank you
-	Go Beyond the California Rolls... 
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The sushi here is delicious!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was courteous and attentive.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Mediocre food
-	– We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.
-	We ordered the marinated grapes, buffalo style chicken wings, and the turkey sandwich.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service was decent.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Drinks were good.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	You are likely to be disappointed.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Best Indian food in L.A.
-	– I've been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A., and this is still my favorite.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	hidden little jem
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	– tucked away over by the Beverly Center.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Never too crowded and always great service.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I appreciate their delivery too.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Nice food but no spice!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	– I really enjoyed my meal here.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was all good but it was way too mild.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.
-	I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Even the chickpeas, which I normally find too dry, were good.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	awesome find
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I love the warm & cosy environment.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager

__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Also have great margaritas!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Lebanese Food!Yum!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I've been to Open Sesame only once, but I'm still reeling from the experience!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is simply unforgettable!
-	I had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The presentation of the food was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!
-	Her sister had the baklava for dessert!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	What a tastly, flaky treat!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	GO TO OPEN SESAME!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Holy Hummus!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during lunch.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	However, this place is a gem, and I won't stop going back.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	great beer
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The band was very good and the service was attentive.
-	Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park, children were running around while their parents sipped wine.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We did have the same waiter the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Seattle's BEST Winelist
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse wine list.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The sommelier is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	I would go back for the wine experience alone.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Nice job!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– It is sad to see a place that was once "THE" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big "DONT BOTHER."
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#PRICES	The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the "Dive" category.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	The coffe is very good, too.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great open and friendly ambience.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	This place is charming and relaxing.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful.
-	It reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	It's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Old Reliable
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– After 12 years in Seattle Ray's rates as the place we always go back to.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Great food, spectacular location, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Enjoyed the food
-	– First of all, I am not from Long Beach.
-	I was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant.
-	(She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time.)
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I liked it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	Food was good and cheap.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did, since it was delicious.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Atmosphere was nice.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Service was kind of slow, our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Still I would recommend this place.
-	BTW, I really like Long Beach.
-	It was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	WOW!!!!!!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– IT CANT GET ANY BETTER!!!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great food with an awesome atmosphere!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	plus, i am allergic to rice, and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	and the waiter suggested a perfect sake!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	absolutely fabulous!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Unbeatable sushi!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Two thumbs up!
-	I love sushi, and I have eaten it all over the world.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi, and very tasty rolls too.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Be sure to try the oyster roll.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	splendid

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I can't saybenough good things about this restaurant, and I can't wait for my next several visits.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Perfect on a cold day.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	$6 with tip.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Perfection.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	Good Sushi, High Price 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	One of the best Sushi place in town.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The house special roll is really good.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	On weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	A cozy spot for 2
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	– I can't believe Murphy's has been around for over 25 years, amazing.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	That's a huge compliment, especially in the fickled restaurant business, ...enough already!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... egg white omelet, the food is always freshly prepared.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Save room for  scrumptious desserts.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you won't forget!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I guarantee you won't be disappointed, there's also valet parking.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Addicting!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I went there with a friend from out of town... and we were both very impressed!
-	Went on a Monday night, so there was no wait for a table.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The price was right too.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere was just okay.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Space was limited, but the food made up for it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I'd go back there in a heartbeat.
-	Should have gone to Trader Joe's and had frozen pizza :(
-	– My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner.
-	The restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted "wait to be seated."
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked, "Are you waiting for a table?"
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.
-	The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker's Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago (a distant second).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	It was decent but nothing exceptional.
-	This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group.
-	We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing.
-	I'm a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening.
-	Well, I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management  to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Great food, better Margaritas!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!

__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Check out the art on the walls, very colorful!

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The nicest waiters in town.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	WAY OVER-RATED!!!!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– This place is unbelievably over-rated.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	10!

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	There is only one place on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.
-	Better than nobu, tomoe, taka, yama, sugiyama, and the rest.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: BLUE RIBBON SUSHI.
-	Believe it baby!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Cut to the chase - this is amazing!
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It's unpretentious and underground.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It's fresh, welcoming, delicious, and relaxing.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Hands down, the best tuna I have ever had.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Blue Ribbon lives up to it's fantastic reputation.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	What a find!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Well worth it 
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Good for late night dining (last minute planning) without reservations.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Poor customer service poor pizza.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#PRICES	– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the food was overpriced.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places, but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	To be honest, I've had better frozen pizza.
-	I'm not kidding.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Love it every time 
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.
-	People complain about the dim lighting, but that is one what I love about this place - if you want to stare at your food in bright light, go to McDonalds.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The only problem would be the wait, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Never had one single problem there.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Seafood Plus
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– This was  great dining experience.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The appetizer of oysters, lobster, crab (small size) made a perfect entre for my wife.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Seabass on lobster risotto was the best.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Caesar salad was superb.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY	Great bottle of wine.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Leave room for dessert.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	COMPLETELY OVER RATED!
-	I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners, drive-ins and dives reviews.
-	I noice most reviews mention the bad service.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We had a very hard time getting the waitress' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	It was clear he didn’t really care.
-	With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal, this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	AVOID THE PLACE
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.
-	I made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.
-	After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We left without ever getting service.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.
-	There are so many better places to visit!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Best Crab Cakes in Town
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	If you can, come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Always a winner.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Great Pizza, Poor Service
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	– Love their pizza, especially the mushroom pizza.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Also love their caeser salad.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the servers, one young woman in particular.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great Breakfast
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	– This place is famous for their breakfast.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY	The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I love breakfast here.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their crab eggs benedict is addicting.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	All their menu items are a hit, and they serve mimosas.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Doesn't get any better than that.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
-	– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night.
-	there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.
-	we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	yummy.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted.
-	next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	the brocollis were so fresh and tasty.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	not chewy at all.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	melt in your mouth.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.
-	every month if possible.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Chintzy portions
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Terrible service, food ok, pricey
-	– This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards.
-	So for the 'after beach excursion', we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet.
-	The restaurant was busy, however there were a few tables open.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.
-	So here we are, my wife, 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building (where the murals and artifacts are).
-	30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!
-	Logic behind that?
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	None that I can think of.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Um so now what are appetizers for???
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.
-	Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
-	The upside of the restaurant?
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.
-	I'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Always good.
-	– A sushi-fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Their specialty rolls are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	Great selection of sakes.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Green tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Very poor customer service.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The manager continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.
-	Next time we will go somewhere else, or try other restaurants close by like Mimi's Cafe and Claim Jumper.
-	1 o'clock in the morning.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	great service.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	good sake selection.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Dungeness crabs here!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	And they give good quantity for the price.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked Rays for dinner!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting....yummy!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Great Breakfast
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	– Great drinks , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	The service is fantastic at this fun place.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open, you know it is great.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This is the case at this gem.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Best Neighborhood Standby.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	You Can't Go Wrong Here.
-	– Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The music is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Seriously, you can't go wrong, if it is unpretentious local fun you seek.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Oh, and the cheese fries are awesome!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Good Food, Great Service, Average Prices (For the Strip)
__label__FOOD#PRICES	– I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.
-	We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner, which came with: 1) Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad, 2) 9 oz steak (with a single potato chip), and 3) homemade donut holes.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It wasn't the freshest seafood ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.
-	Before the steak came, the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.
-	It was steamed and tossed with garlic.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.
-	Finally, the homemade donut holes were served for desert.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and tip (about average).
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Overall, I would go back and eat at the restaurant again.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	good sake, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.
-	In the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me.
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Server made several sake suggestions which were very good.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	VERY GOOD!
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Overpriced
-	– We dined at the Colorado location today.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Also, there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	At best, the food was good and definately overpriced.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Not sure if I would go back.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	My favortie pizza joint in Seattle
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– This is my "must bring out of town guests to" restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	It's just the right size for the menu.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Excellent
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	We’re can’t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza’s!
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	You won’t be disappointed by their menu.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pizza’s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	You never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The pizza’s are light and scrumptious.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Try the Pizza Ensalata!
-	It’s a salad on top of pizza crust.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Absolutely delicious.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pizza’s are not huge and the crust is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Worth the wait
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food is sinful.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The staff was really friendly.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere was great.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The specialty here is decadent pancakes, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Nothing on the menu is less than amazing.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Good eats.
-	Whose writing all the great reviews?
-	Why is it that (almost) every good review is by "anonymous?"
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I have been to this place, folks and it is BAD.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that's half-way decent.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#PRICES	I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.
__label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	DONOT GO!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Delicious

__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	We waited for an hour to be seated.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The service was excellent, the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Will definitely be back.
-	Southglenn is largest location.

__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	To the owners of Open Sesame...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Delectable 
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	It's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Once you're inside, the real experience begins.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is delectable.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	big thick pepperoni
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	– The pepperoni's cut real thick--Yum.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	The pizza itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Sit in the Balcony
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– Not bad.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Food was good and appetizing.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Portions was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	Fair menu selection.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The appetizer was interesting, but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Indoor ambience was modern.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	If it's nice outside, request for a table in the balcony.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	It's a great place to people watch.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	Late night dinning with exeptional food.
-	– I didn't want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet.
-	That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The portions are big though, so do not order too much.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Groovy music made the dinner casual.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.
-	There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink.
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This place rocks!!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY	– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty, the service is undeniably awesome!
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The chips  and salsa are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The atmosphere is aspiring, and  the decor is festive and amazing..
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	The catering is out of this world, and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world!!!
__label__DRINKS#QUALITY __label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.
__label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	Insultingly Overpriced
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	- Mediocre Service Quality
-	– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch:  I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service, so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed.
__label__AMBIENCE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__RESTAURANT#PRICES	The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.
__label__DRINKS#PRICES	To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.
__label__DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__DRINKS#PRICES	They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES	The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.
-	The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__SERVICE#GENERAL	To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__FOOD#PRICES __label__DRINKS#PRICES __label__DRINKS#PRICES	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).
-	This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep.
-	Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering, but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Much more than just a great view!
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL	To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.
__label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).
__label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__FOOD#QUALITY	My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.
__label__FOOD#QUALITY	I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?
__label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
-	Given that Ray's is a seafood restaurant...well, you get the idea...
__label__RESTAURANT#GENERAL	All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.
__label__SERVICE#GENERAL __label__FOOD#QUALITY __label__RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.
__label__LOCATION#GENERAL	Oh yeah...the view was good, too.
