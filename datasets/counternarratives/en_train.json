{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"This statement seems to me inappropriate. Can you explain to me what is the source of so much hatred?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Another myth that is in line with the theory of the great replacement."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"If you refer to the young men and girls who emigrate from African countries, I would like to remind you that many are Christian. Immigration also does not lead to an increase in diseases."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The Koran teaches to the faithful to tolerate other religions and to respect them. Muslims can only transmit their own principles, but without using force."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Provide examples of those in the muslim community working."}
{"HS":"This is the ideology of islam: have a mosque, create a community, claim victimhood, gain support from government, exploit laws, establish sharia, take control of the country.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"What type?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Do you know how many mosques are there in Italy? 10, we have instead 66,994 churches, so what are you referring to exactly?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"You confuse Arab with Muslim."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs."}
{"HS":"Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK!","CN":"Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population. Stop trying to depict Muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Italy is a laic state. The crucifix should not be at school."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"If only we tried to integrate them really, rather than relegate them to the margins of our society, perhaps the phenomena of violence would be limited."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Insult and defamation."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"Hello, could you give me a figure on the number of Muslims in Italy?"}
{"HS":"These 8 criminals are all Muslims because their victims are always white or Non-Muslim!","CN":"Criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? Seems a lot of bother to me."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is already long been the first religion in terms of practitioners."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam is a religion, like Christianity and Judaism, it has nothing to do with terrorism, it is a dangerous and offensive generalization."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"To do what?"}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Muslims are actively involved in the French economy and are a source of wealth for it."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"What is the conversion rate to the Muslim religion?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"My country is France."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is like the movie E. T or invaders otherwise JUST STOP NETFLIX from time to time."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"Are they nice? That is sweet, but you know there is a little bit of everything."}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"Secularism is precisely the right to live one's religion to the full. It is a private matter."}
{"HS":"I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam.","CN":"Public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to Islam."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Even if true, how does hatred counter hatred?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"When you're an immigrant in a country that welcomes you with respect, you're the first to want to demonstrate that you respect the rules that are there, respect is a two-way mutual function."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"What is your number? You have futuristic visions."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Evidence for this? All crime and hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"The myth that Muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. Don't believe everything you read."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"This veil discriminates them. They have a high unemployment, but whose fault? To the one who discriminates or to the victim?"}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"These are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikely to be perceived as 'devout'. More about behaviours than matters of doctrine."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Verbal aggression."}
{"HS":"They should open the mosques at their homes.","CN":"For members of Islamic communities in Italy and in Europe this is their home."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"If I were trying to strangle you with my veil, your words would be justified; but now you are really exaggerating a lot."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I translate for you: Muslims no longer wish to be discriminated against and scapegoats for all the evils of society, they have no right."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"You are aware there are millions of Muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Ok, if you say so."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"You have been saying the same thing for 60 years, nothing has been invaded."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"I think any book written that long ago probably would."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"What do you mean by 'islamized'? If mosques are built in some areas, I do not see this as a threat but as representation of community in those areas?"}
{"HS":"These islamic beasts rape their and our women, after all their religion allows it to them!","CN":"Hi, I also condemn these acts that are so atrocious, but it seems to me unfair to put on the same boat all the people who form this religion. The Muslim religion does not permit such acts and their perpetrators should be considered criminals, regardless of their faith or nationality."}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"And tell me, how long did you spend studying the Quran? How long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with Muslims and their faith to understand them and Islam? How is it that you happen to know what Islam truly is?"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"In fact, Muslims have continued to help our society. For instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. Muslims also have condemned terrorism and ISIS in plentiful news medias around the world."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Our whom? If it relates to the Italian women I have and I do not feel safe in reading your words. The problem is not Muslims, but the too local mentality in which man feels the woman is his property."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"I invite you to my home and you come away with new knowledge."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"Putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"You sure?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"My country is yours too."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"But if they barely manage to reach the Italian coast without dying, how do you believe that they can impose on an entire nation?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"I know of no religious party in France, what are we talking about? French women?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Freedom equality and brotherhood are also Muslim values."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"A linguistic creation to manipulate public opinion."}
{"HS":"Muslims want to make all French meat halal.","CN":"We do not force anyone to eat hallal."}
{"HS":"Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.","CN":"Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veiled women are not subject to the dictates of fashion and the desire of men."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Every man has his own traits. Muslim men are millions and you cannot generalize."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Always to politicize your intolerance."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"Don't most religions have instructions for what they deem to be 'righteous living', voluntary codes or laws (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"No it isn't? Diversity is a strength."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes. Criminals are not all of a certain race or religion, but one race and religion produces criminals.","CN":"Today, in many Muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. For example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"Respecting their religion and their way of life would definitely be a better idea."}
{"HS":"They should open the mosques at their homes.","CN":"Opening a mosque would employ construction firms and workers. If you knew that would give financial support to live to 20 families for 5 years, would it be otherwise?"}
{"HS":"It is time for us to take Islam for what it is. A murderous cult that should be exterminated, and that is the end of it.","CN":"This feels like a 'Final solution' to me. Are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the UK population? Get a grip."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Politicians have made a problem with Islam that has existed for 1400 years and nobody complained about it."}
{"HS":"People who criticize Islam and its traits in our country - rape gangs and terrorism - are being banned, but this will not end well. People are driven to the right - the only ones who can openly talk about it!","CN":"Right wing is earning popularity by blaming Muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Are you sure it is not just that Muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage?"}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"That is why millions of them come to live in countries where the majority of the population is not Muslim."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Christians also practise FGM. It is not a uniquely Muslim problem."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Muslims in Italy are about 2% of the population. I find it difficult to think that they become a majority. And in any case many Muslim women do not wear the veil."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"How is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"It seems to me there isn't a prevalence of Italian women (if by 'our' you referred to those) raped by Muslims rather than by their fathers, husbands, confessors, priests ."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Says who?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I am not responsible for your perception of my veil."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Better be interested in those women who have veil in their mind and not on their heads."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Just like the police, forced to wear the helmet!"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"While it is well known, Christianity was created at the same time in all the countries of the world where it is the major religion."}
{"HS":"I wish all of them would die.","CN":"For all who are you referring to? Your statement is very general."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a bestial cult of brainwashed lunatics who breed like rats.","CN":"Since when having a family is portrayed in such a dehumanizing way?"}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"Islam has arrived well before Europe, so the connection of Islam with Europe is not correct."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Do you have data related to the incidence of diseases because of the migration? For me, it does not appear so."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"In the same way that a wedding veil would be the demonstration of a political marriage? A bit serious, don't you think? Your tweet is the demonstration of limited knowledge."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype)"}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Hello, saying that Italy is a Christian country is conceptually wrong: Italy is laic, the article 7 of the constitution states this."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then?"}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Hi, I think it is important, however, to differentiate between those who commit atrocious violence in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their faith in a peaceful manner and respect the culture of others. It is not a question of religion, but on how it is interpreted by a few alleged men of faith."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Why are you so sure of this? Muslims happily live in other Western societies without any problems."}
{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Good luck! Try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Good evening, think that the figures show that 4 of 5 women are raped by Italians. Can you bring data to support his theory?"}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"So many adjectives that you stack up!"}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"Anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so?"}
{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"This is not true."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It's like saying all Italians are mobsters! We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"And a third not for hate."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"Statistics and facts simply prove this wrong."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Have you discussed it with veiled women to make such statements?"}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Such dehumanising language against many people."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics)."}
{"HS":"If white British men were raping muslim girls, they would be already in jail or murdered. Why double standards and privileges for Muslims?","CN":"This isn't. This is a false dichotomy. All crime and hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Terrorism does not depend on religion."}
{"HS":"In the swimming pool there are baths only for Muslims, I cannot enter. If I, a white men, asked for something like this nobody would allow me. Muslims can do anything they want.","CN":"Men Only' sessions are Friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. So what is this, 'Patriarchal Appeasement'?"}
{"HS":"There should be no Mosque in this country. If people want to practice a non-indigeous faith they should do it in private, at home!!","CN":"Aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers?"}
{"HS":"Muslims want to make all French meat halal.","CN":"Every cult has its own meat. How is it a problem for you to eat hallal meat as long as you have no ban?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"The negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all Muslims. Don't believe everything you read."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Look at crime stats."}
{"HS":"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight.","CN":"Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"How can you say a person is a potential terrorist?"}
{"HS":"Great Britain is not Great anymore, it is a shadow of its former self because of the cancer which is an islamic invasion.","CN":"Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The demonstration or demonstrations there is one too many and gaps in general knowledge."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Really? Even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our NHS going? Those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"I do not think that people requesting political asylum in Italy come here for no reason. They flee because in their homeland there wasn't a situation that favoured their stay. We cannot talk about a replacement because the Muslim population represents only a small part of the total Italian population. Men do not hit women, and only the most radical forms of Islam impose the burqa."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"It would be interesting to have information about this, can you provide them?"}
{"HS":"These Islamists only think about stealing.","CN":"Are you sure that you did not see another movie? Like the one that talks about the theft of 49 million ."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"In the terrorist attacks, people die, without distinction of who they are, regardless of their religion, whether Catholic or Muslim or atheist. Islam is not terrorism."}
{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true."}
{"HS":"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims.","CN":"I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs exercise."}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"Example?"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Housewives are of all religions."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Actions of a few people do not represent an entire community."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"You talk like a real gentleman."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"With such a false statement, it is sure that we cannot trust your judgement! This way of essentialisation will not convince anyone."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Muslims are not a problem. They seek their place in society and that has inspired them to live in peace but do not wish to live hidden or be assimilated. We are all a part of our society."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is an attempt to manipulate public opinion."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate."}
{"HS":"Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves.","CN":"I think people are banned because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Why do you think Islam is evil? The major beliefs in Islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. For instance, they teach people to respect the lands and all creatures."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"The Christian world can be far from tolerant. Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?"}
{"HS":"How boring these Muslims who put their prophet everywhere!","CN":"Without exaggeration, it seems to me that there is worse than the prophet . Like the feeling of shame and guilt of those who administer the cult."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on.","CN":"Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no different from us."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Can you show me an exact location in Koran where people are encouraged to do this? I do not think so."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Watch the news, the Popes just acknowledged abuse of Nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. The problem is society is not restricted to anyone's religion."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?"}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"It is quite a generalisation to say anyone from Pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. Nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"At most, children are just learning more about different religions. You are using very strong and unnecessary words here."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Gender-based violence is not an Islamic problem, it's a social problem of all."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"In the Koran, there is not even a word that can legitimize or at least justify terrorism. I invite you to read it to enrich the general culture."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Arabs are not all terrorists, a generalization like this is dangerous, as it is dangerous to think to solve the problem of terrorism by answering with the same violence."}
{"HS":"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.","CN":"Everyone must be able to express their faith."}
{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!","CN":"I agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or Governments."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world."}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"Did you miss 'Some.' from the beginning of this Tweet?"}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Why do you consider Muslims like beasts? Did they do something wrong? If you take into consideration the crimes committed by Muslims, why do you distinguish the Muslim criminals from the non-Muslim? They are all criminals and all of them are punished."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Try running the NHS without them and other migrants!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Wearing a veil is just a religious freedom."}
{"HS":"Is it a fundamental principle of Islam that they have to pray in the street, or do they do it just to piss off us infidels?","CN":"How many times have you seen evangelical Christian preachers and followers on the streets most Saturdays in most UK cities? You do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Some veiled women prefer to devote themselves to the education of their children."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Muslims have been in Europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The veil is not mandatory in most Muslim countries. Let alone in countries with a quite different tradition."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Your afternoon tea."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Hi, I do not believe that Islam is inherently violent, indeed: the Koran does not allow violence towards those who believe the same or different religions, except to protect themselves from an attack suffered. We must not confuse religion itself with those who commit violence claiming to be inspired by this."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"If it wasn't for a Muslim I would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is one of the major religions, there is also open dialogue with Christianity. Fanaticism is not exclusive to Islam."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. It often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is through religious conviction."}

{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace."}

{"HS":"Islam purpose is only the conquest.","CN":"If it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. What about Christianity and colonialism?"}
{"HS":"Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate.","CN":"95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk)"}

They are a problem!","CN":"Doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all British Citizens have?

{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"People run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. They run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. Pushing them back into their disasters is not humane."}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"A friend of mine married a Muslim man. He is always so sweet, takes her hand across the road, he opens her the door when entering a room. Gestures that I hardly see in all men. He will not be better than others because he's a Muslim, what I'm certain about is that he is not even worse because he's a Muslim.

We must fight.","CN":"I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?"}

{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"French Muslims do not take advantage of the system because it is open to all French citizens!"}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"Pioneered science."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I don't know how to answer that question."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Your statements incite hatred and are punishable under the law."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is exactly because it is not true that you have a problem with that!"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"How about influential figures like Baroness Sayeeda Warsi? Or Harvard Fellow Hayfa Al-Kaylani? Should I list some more brilliantly smart Muslim women?"}
{"HS":"Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease!","CN":"Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Tolerance is the foundation."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"If you have examples of those around you for whom the person was obliged, advise that person that they can file a complaint."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Who says the problem says the solution."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Women struggle to not be forced to wear the veil in the countries of the Muslim world which make it compulsory, but they don't deny their belonging to Islam."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Terrorists come in all religions and political views. People opposing Trump were sent letter bombs, the 'Troubles' saw Christian terrorists on both sides of the border. Let's challenge all terrorism."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"A Muslim is made of all colors."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Italy is a laic country, the school is a place for education and dialogue, not worship."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc.","CN":"Actually, I think that the whole point of #VisitMyMosque is to ask questions."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the US) than those motivated by Islamic extremism."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?)."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"List of positive news stories."}
{"HS":"Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams!","CN":"Do you know that anti-Islamism is actually a form of anti-Semitism? It is equally wrong to hate Jews and Muslims."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Really, with napalm. And then where? They are not all terrorists as you say, some belong to ISIS but others are people like you and me."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Why is it aggressive to you?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"I do not agree. There are really emancipated Muslim women, do you know the models Gigi and Bella Hadid? They are Muslim, did you know?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Let's throw the baby out with the bathwater. The same once was said about southerners."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"The only cover up I remember was in the Catholic Church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole."}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy!"}
{"HS":"They should open the mosques at their homes.","CN":"Why should they open churches in their native country if they can't even go there? I do not see the point."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"The earth IS God's, not yours."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."}
{"HS":"(reacting to a terrorist attack :) of course still a blue-eyed blond named Edouard.","CN":"Edward is nice despite his appearance."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Do you think that it's plausible to think that our country in a few years will be controlled by Muslims, that they will impose us the way in which they think, dress, live .?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The Republic has not always respected its own values: slavery, colonialism, the inferiorization of women. When you point fingers, four fingers point you!"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Who we?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Islam is a religion of balance."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"If we end up with a hard border I hope we do not find out."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"Do you differentiate between Arabic and Muslim?"}
{"HS":"If they love Sharia law so much, why do not they go off and live in a Muslim country?","CN":"Sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the Quran with many interpretations."}
{"HS":"It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up!","CN":"My friend, but do you really know what Islammic ideology is?"}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"What about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? Do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'?"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"I am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"You'll have to demonstrate it to me."}
{"HS":"When we welcome Muslims in our country we welcome paedophiles, rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia.","CN":"That is not true. Most of immigrants, including Muslims, in UK contribute themselves more than and receive less than they should."}
{"HS":"We let them in and then we find terrorists in our home.","CN":"I would say that assimilate Muslim immigrants to terrorists is a bit too much."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"This comment is so unfounded."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islam does not promote politics."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Another theory forwarded by Islamophobic."}
{"HS":"To the minister: start counteracting terror and crisis caused by Islam! Stop burying your heads in sand.","CN":"Can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? I do not see it in our society."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Isn't this a clich\ufffd\ufffd?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Not all Muslims want to impose their beliefs. Generalization is never good!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Which?"}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!"}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"It wasn't Muslims protecting Jimmy Saville or Gary Glitter, how many more public figures will we find? It wasn't Muslims turning a blind eye to those in the Church in Ireland or the Vatican. Let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat."}
{"HS":"I wish all of them would die.","CN":"You cannot think that the entire Muslim population dies. Why would you do something so horrible?"}
{"HS":"Has our political elite forgotten that we were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of mosques is related to the number of the faithful."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"Learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? I strongly disagree."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Just wondering what Muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Not at all the veil and protection."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Unfortunately, violence against women has no nationality, color or religion. It must be fought in any case, not only if it is committed by a Muslim."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"But as Muslims contribute Billions to the economy, build SMEs, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Really? Cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"As is every far right armchair activist."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Most child abusers in the UK are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This statement is like saying \"Germans are all xenophobic anti-Semitic\"."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women only inspire to flourish in the society in which they live. If she does not work, it is because of the difficulty of working, because of the discrimination against her."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Maybe in other countries but not in France."}
{"HS":"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.","CN":"How old are you? The first Mosque in the UK was built in 1889!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"This is what the media want to show when it is totally false."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"I think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Discrimination."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It becomes too Islamophobic and the media gives it too much echo."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are French."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"This is not true."}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and living in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion."}
{"HS":"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims.","CN":"Wish I could believe everything I read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Ah, are they all the same?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims are in all countries."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"I do not think that talking about invasion is correct. Most migrants that arrive in Italy are distributed in the rest of Europe, where Italy is second last in number of immigrants for inhabitant."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Source please?"}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"Shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated?"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"There seems to be a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some faraway coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!"}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"How can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks?"}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"This speech targets immigrants in general, but to be accepted with a climate of hatred against Muslims, he changed the name of the target. Among the eastern immigrants, for example, there are Christians and Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse."}
{"HS":"Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?","CN":"Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even if it is a small contribution. For example, teach children to arm themselves and report suspicious events."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"It seems like you are against Muslims if you are saying something like this? Why is that?"}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"In Italy Muslims are less than 5%, I personally would not call it an invasion."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"That sounds like quite a threat. Remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Unless you consider spending over 20 Billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in London and that is before we talk about the international contribution."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Wasn't the same thing said about Jews less than a century ago?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"A 'civilised Europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; Islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are anti-semitic.","CN":"Muslims are not anti-semitic."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"More competition = lower prices and cheap indulgences."}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion."}
{"HS":"Don't the Moslem's Holy books say 'kill infidels wherever they may be hiding'.","CN":"All hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is just a piece of tissue."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"In 2030 in France 10% of the population in France will be Muslim. That is an overwhelming majority ;-)"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Do not confuse the alleged religious who kill in the name of their faith with those who regularly and peacefully practice their religion."}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"Because throw away comments on reality TV are always true? I think you need to be less trusting and check your sources."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Mgm FGM have been in Britain for hundreds of years. It is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims have contributed much to the UK due to their sterling educational achievements. More than half of Muslim schools in England surpass the national percentage GCSE average of 5 or more GCSE's or equivalent A*-C grades including English and Math GCSEs. This enables Muslims to work in important fields of Medicine and Law amongst others to enrich the lives of UK citizens."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Prejudice leads to hate."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Can you explain each term to me?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"We must learn before saying anything."}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"Christian ideology is even more ancient than Islam, and Buddhism is even centuries older. Are you suggesting to ban all the religions? Or are you specifically picky about Islam?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Islam is a religion, not a nationality. You can be French Muslim just like French Jewish or Christian or other."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Your words confirm that you ignore the definition of your words."}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Most child abusers in the UK are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men?"}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as in the Catholic church attitudes in Islam are changing fast."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women do not need you to express the opinion in their place."}
{"HS":"Muslims, their texts as hate literature, and other manifestations of hate and genocide should be eradicated. We should have no tolerance towards this cult of hate! Imprison supporters of Islam, wake up Britain!","CN":"Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"If you stop bludgeoning us all the time, we'd be able to communicate more easily."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too."}
{"HS":"Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. )","CN":"Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Good evening, in Italy there are about 1,400,000 Muslims, but I do not think they are all criminals. Actually, the vast majority are an excellent example of great coexistence among people of different religions."}
{"HS":"Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate.","CN":"What is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?)."}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"No religion belongs to Europe."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Arabic, Islamic and terrorist are very different terms that we must learn to use. Arab: inhabitants of Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Muslims: those who profess the religion of Islam Terrorists: Islam extremists."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Define the four terms you just mentioned."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Violence is a muslim issue. Especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Muslims have been part of the British fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Veiled women in France are persecuted and especially discriminated against because of their veils."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Do not stop them from working and studying then."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"It is absolutely untrue that they want to impose their religion, there is no such case. They only ask to be able to respect their religion (and that it is respected), even here in Italy."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"If you do not think Muslims have ever done anything for 'us' I think you need to do a quick google search. The evidence of Muslims contributions to society is everywhere!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Apolitical veil."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I even heard from NKM that they would even be Kouffarists."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Hi, do you think that the comparison with a culture and religion different from ours is not a source of enrichment?"}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Islam preaches living together."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Hi, I do not consider that Islam, as a religion, professes violence. There are, if anything, certainly alleged believers that exploit religious justification to commit terrible acts, but which have nothing to do with true religion."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Do you have statistics on the growth of Islam?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The statistics state that the rapists are almost always Italian."}
{"HS":"Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims.","CN":"Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why is there a need to create division?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?"}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"I do not see why one or the other have to adapt."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"What kind of changes do you fear that could happen?"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"No, it is not a fact because it is simply not true."}
{"HS":"People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it.","CN":"Rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to Muslims only? This is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Ahhhh, well! Ahhhh it is for this reason that more and more French people are moving abroad! In the sun! Uh, in Muslim countries where it is good to live!"}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"This is a very sad story! But every Muslim person I know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the Qu'ran."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"What makes you say that ?"}
{"HS":"People who criticize Islam and its traits in our country - rape gangs and terrorism - are being banned, but this will not end well. People are driven to the right - the only ones who can openly talk about it!","CN":"Hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"There are no populations naturally more violent than others."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"All known terrorists had no Islamic practice until then, their profile is known to everyone!"}
{"HS":"Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. )","CN":"Yeah, so what is your point? It looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the West."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Forgot fundamentalist, racist, Welfare beneficiaries. Do you have any more?"}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"The number of Muslims in the world is fast growing. Do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that many followers?"}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Have you read Qu'ran? Do you know what it states? I suppose not. How can you then judge the statements there?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is not an obligation, it is a choice."}
{"HS":"Westerners believe Islam is incompatible with their world. They consider it a religion worse than others. There are surveys about this.","CN":"The horrors of Daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of Islam proliferating in both online and offline media. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really."}
{"HS":"Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you!","CN":"What happened, my friend? Do you want to talk about what is in your mind?"}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"Do you really think that an ordinary and innocent person like us should suffer violence? Why?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"The truth has never frightened the honest man! But you may not be in the end, which would explain this determination."}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Islam is a recognized religion, your hate is the disease. Do not try to contaminate us."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"What do you base your view on?"}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"The WE in WEstern symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true Westerner, respect others!!"}

We live in more enlightened times."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"And so Ghandi said, ' An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Muslims really are the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. How about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame."}

{"HS":"Isis Bride wants to return to the UK. Let her rot. A dog born in a stable is not a horse. Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH!","CN":"Dog's and horse's do not have passports. A stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Do you not believe that everyone should be free to practice their religion?"}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Even if people follow Sharia Law, it does not mean that country has to accept it officially."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I saw so many different veils in the shapes and colors, you will surely find one you like."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Who confirmed it? What are your sources?"}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes.

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"There is a lack of an opportunistic slave driver."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Muslims are not the Islam. They are trying to practice and believe in a religion that does not have to bear responsibility for everyone, and fools are not religions, Muslims are not a problem, but you who have a problem with Muslims in the end."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"We could just wait for a next hitler and maybe we too will become victims ?."}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!"}

Yet today, statistics tell us that 14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians (for several generations), witnesses that Islam has not been answered with the sword. Muslims ruled India for about a millennium. Today, more than 80% of Indians are non-Muslim, a sign that Islam was not imposed by the sword. The most populated regions in Muslims are the east coast of Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, while no Muslim armed forces have gone to these regions, which were conquered only by the intellectual sword."}

{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"I take it you have never eaten a curry then?"}
{"HS":"Whether you accept it or not, people are concerned with Islamic rape gangs and the spread of extremism.","CN":"As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims.

{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims."}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"The France is our country."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Everyone has the right to pray in their own place of worship. Their mosques are not competing with the Christian churches, even between the two religions we can establish a relationship of dialogue."}

{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I do not believe that people of a particular religious affiliation would be able to cause diseases and reduce us to starvation."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Deported where? They are UK Citizens?"}

{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"And vice-versa."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The Muslim population in Italy amounts to less than 3% of the total.

{"HS":"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.","CN":"This is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Yes, except that HIV is more common among Christians and it's not a contact disease."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is not a Muslim-only issue. It is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"No one's saying do not ask questions. Maybe if you did the answers would surprise you."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal.","CN":"While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools."}
{"HS":"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists.","CN":"According to Crown Prosecution Service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. What did this happen? We should stop hating and complaining about others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. If you want to help, please contact National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Lucy Faithful Foundation, or Independent Sexual Violence Advocates."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Islam has given many things to the Western society. For example, medicine, mathematics. These things belong with our society. It is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"The image that the media give of Islam, as a warmongering religion, which seeks to conquer the West and to fight Christians in the world, is false and instrumental. It was clearly said to Vatican Radio by the great imam Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently received from Pope Francis: 'Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. And those who kill Muslims and even kill Christians have misunderstood Islam texts either intentionally or through negligence. ' the University of Cairo that he heads is committed to clarify the concepts of the Koran, which are diverted from armed movements that use violence and terrorism, claiming to work for peace. 'we cannot blame religions,' added the Grand Imam, 'because of the deviations of some of their followers.'."}

Imprison supporters of Islam, wake up Britain!","CN":"If you read Qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it.

{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Instead it is a sign of respect, not all of us profess the same religion."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It seems to me that you are generalizing, throwing the baby out from the bathwater. The migrants in Italy think to work and support their families, not certainly to carry out attacks. As the majority of Italians."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They are not subject to anyone but God."}
{"HS":"It is time for us to take Islam for what it is. A murderous cult that should be exterminated, and that is the end of it.","CN":"There's more in Islam than death and terror. It has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic!"}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"How does a religion cause death? Sounds a bit extreme, no?!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am in my country France."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset."}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!"}
{"HS":"Hijab means Islam, Islam means woman and child oppression, rapism, intolerance, chauvinism. I do not like hijab and everything else that follows!","CN":"Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"That is not true. As proof, women of other faiths may wear a veil, among Christian or Jewish women for example."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"The ONS says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. Lock up all married people (and divorcees)!"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"How can you repatriate citizens of your own country? This is just ignorance."}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"Muslims also contribute a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Hi, actually there are several experts of this religion who explained that those who commit acts of violence do so in violation of the same rules of the Koran, that only provide self-defense in case of a serious attack suffered. Those who commit these crimes, in short, do not know and do not profess the true Muslim faith."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Deported where? They are UK Citizens?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"This is the way you see it, in any case, it isn't its purpose. I freely wear it, religiously, for myself."}

{"HS":"Muslims want to impose Sharia law in Europe.","CN":"Muslims do not impose anything."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it."}
{"HS":"We must eliminate this cult of hate and its supporters. Their literature is all about genocide and hate. Wake up Britain!","CN":"If you read Qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. Statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. Do not confuse criminals and common people!"}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Can I suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the UK does not reflect 'our values' in the way I understand them."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I was born in France so I'm already there."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"The fear of the unknown."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"So you know all veiled women and the context in which they started to put it? I am a researcher. I am interested."}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Hi, I would suggest you to do some research about Islam. Islam is a peaceful religion that quite definitely not profess violence."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"That is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?"}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"That's why Koran is taught in school!"}

{"HS":"Our country is fighting a war against Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"2.5 million Muslims travelled to Europe to fight for the Allies in WW1."}

{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I see more and more uninhibited racism and a fixation on Muslims!"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Provide unemployment data breakdown if possible."}
{"HS":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","CN":"Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"There are some Islamic fanatics, just as there are some Christian or Hindu fanatics. An entire religion cannot be condemned for this."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"You cannot blame all people for the actions of a few. Banning something altogether will not solve anything."}
{"HS":"Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british!","CN":"A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but it's still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizens, be they good or evil surely?"}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Everyone can maintain their own culture, but you must also try to understand the others one without discrimination and prejudice based on ignorance."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Secularism allows it."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Not all Italians are Christians, and I think that the churches in Italy are not lacking. Certainly, it does not seem trivial to build as many mosques in the near future."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?"}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"The truth is the worldwide Muslims denounce ISIS and its violence. Plus, many Muslims are the victims of ISIS. According to <The Guardian>, 'Isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global Muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why Muslims from Syria and Iraq may want to migrate to countries like Australia.'."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"I do not think that religion is a matter of competition."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Unicorns eat fairy dust, I said it so it's a fact."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil restores the woman's dignity."}

{"HS":"Muslims want to make all French meat halal.","CN":"We have our own butcher shops."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This is because mass propaganda works well."}

{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Violence is actually more common in the Bible than in the Qur'an. (link to Independent article about analysis of both books finding this). That noted, violence exists within and without religion."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"Can I suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Do you know that you are using a lot of things in your everyday life that Muslims invented, right?"}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"Although, in June 2018, for example, more than 2,000 Afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an Islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in Afghanistan is forbidden under the Islamic law'. So clearly not all Muslim clerics are warmongers."}
{"HS":"If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away.","CN":"A nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I was born in France from French parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. I'm going back to where? In Gaulle?"}

{"HS":"If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away.","CN":"95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk)"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Also your hate."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"I agree that Muslims should adapt to our environment. But we must also talk to them. Only like this we can create a relationship of coexistence and peace."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"The essentialization of people because of their religion, it is a reprehensible hate speech."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"The veil is linked to a religious tradition, so, this would be possible if we share it with all."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Are you a mind reader? And if not, the psg wins the next game?"}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Could you indicate a source that accepts the link between the presence of Muslim citizens and the diseases that you mentioned?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Well look elsewhere."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"What is the point in listening? Maybe because they actually have something good to say?"}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"My dentist told me the Quran says: 'GOD does not love the aggressors.'?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is the very symbol of a fraternal, united and libertarian society."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"I do not share your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or yours, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"We make people study in our schools and they become racists, they are beasts, not men."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"All terrorists? My aunt, married to an Arab man, has two wonderful children and lives in the United States. The Arab man in this case has only won the heart of my aunt, no violence or bombs."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"From what do you presume it? Did you inform yourself well before writing the comment? I ask you to perform in-depth research."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"Oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You can always divert your gaze."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"We live in a free country where everyone dresses up as they want."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"I work. It is not true."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Good evening, send them back home for what accomplished crime? Freely practice their religion?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The napalm? So when they are still 'at home'? How sad, stupid generalizations."}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Islam is a religion that must be respected like all other religions in France."}
{"HS":"Muslims force their child to fast during Ramadan.","CN":"On the contrary, young people like to fast like everyone else."}

{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"A part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. Who identify as muslim?"}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. So I strongly disagree with you on this one."}
{"HS":"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists.","CN":"Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is a crime against Muslims, punishable by law, it is in no way a duty."}

{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"Tea."}

{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Could you explain your point of view?"}
{"HS":"Great Britain is not Great anymore, it is a shadow of its former self because of the cancer which is an islamic invasion.","CN":"No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Where did you obtain this statement from? Can you mention the source? If you have a source please check if it is reliable and read it carefully."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"As all the religions, Islam is only about saving our souls."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Then find concrete evidence that Muslim women are locked up."}

{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Apart from the fact that you couldn't catch HIV like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Please read the Italian Constitution and you will find that Italy is a secular country, not a Christian country, for this reason all religions are accepted."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"And to think that a certain Jesus said that we are all equal, but someone must have misunderstood."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Fortunately there are few who have such a fanatical and crazy interpretation of Islam."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"No one is capable of probing the hearts of others. I don't suppose anyone accuses you of being an American secret agent because of the nike cap you wear?"}

All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence.

{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is the newest target."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Your statement, I confess, has puzzled me, especially when you write that they are beasts and not men, is a statement full of violence, how to take a punch in the stomach."}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Of course it's a lie, a few cases are not the rule."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The Quran explicitly says that the principles of Islam can only be transmitted without using force. So I guess you are mentioning the extremist forms of Islam, which are a minority compared to the whole of religion. We cannot send back migrants because this action would go against our Constitution, which says that you must receive asylum seekers if in their countries the conditions are such as dangerous to endanger them."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"If we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed."}

{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"If it's being intolerant then yes."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'."}

{"HS":"No religion claims to be the 'religion of peace' more than Islam. I wonder why they need to keep repeating this?","CN":"Maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion?"}
{"HS":"We want the borders of Europe closed! And the removal of Africanization and Islam !! They have no tolerance, and with the same tolerance they should be sent home!","CN":"Have you ever met an intolerant Muslim immigrant? Have you ever knew of migrants, and listened to their stories, before you send them back home? Are you sure of what will be the impact of closing the borders on your life? And on all the Italian people working in hospitality?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"These words are stirring and incite fear and hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorists are all frustrated offenders who are rejected by the Society."}

I do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks a different language and possesses a different culture."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Once you burn books you burn people. Has history taught you nothing?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything?","CN":"The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advice or solutions."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"In fact, our organized crime exploits them for the benefit of the GDP and also for his own businesses since it can save on fruits and vegetables due to illegal hiring."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women are not submissive but are free by their choice."}
{"HS":"We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder.","CN":"There's more in Islam than death and terror. It has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic!"}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"I am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"1000s of Muslims died in WW1 and 2 defending Britain, 1000s still in UK armed forces defending peace across the world. Bloody retribution on them, really?"}

{"HS":"These Islamists only think about stealing.","CN":"So they look like our politicians and not only like them."}
{"HS":"These 8 crooks are all Muslims and every one of their victims is Non-Muslim, white-British. Why do these criminals only target White British Non-Muslims?","CN":"Criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? Seems a lot of bother to me."}

{"HS":"This is our import for the last 30 years: muslim rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia. Why are we doing this?","CN":"That is not true. Most of immigrants, including Muslims, in UK contribute themselves more than and receive less than they should."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'?"}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This person likes the words that end in ists. And rhymes!"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"You are afraid of what you don't know."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"So what is your point? Islam is a political religion, the veil does not make it violent or hateful."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"The knowledge western society is built on was discovered by Islamic scholars, then colonists claimed it as their own. Our society would not be so developed without Muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields."}

{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"Islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. Muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. Which of those would you like to get rid of?"}

{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Seriously, I would love to know where you get your statistics from. They are so far from the truth."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The Saudis are exceptions since there is nothing to complain about when it comes to trading with them."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It is wrong to generalize because there would be 1.5 billion terrorists."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?"}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict)"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A Muslim can be subject to psychological disorders like any human being, so before you put everything back on his religion, see if the person you describe is psychologically stable, if not, then sympathize with his condition and offer him to treat himself."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The right of worship is universal and I do not believe that Muslims couldn't profess freely their faith in Italy. We have to talk to them and not be afraid to approach. Only then, we will reach the total tolerance between religions."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Why does their background matter?"}
{"HS":"They constantly say that their religion is a 'religion of peace', maybe because in reality it isn't.","CN":"Maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not?"}

{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"This implies that I came from a part where I was born here."}

{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"What is your hatred of Muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Even the mother of idiots is always pregnant, this does not mean that we can assume the right to castrate it."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"There are many currents in Islam and many ways of practising your religious knowledge according to your free will. What you say makes no sense. I'm not sure you know what you're talking about."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. So I strongly disagree with you on this one."}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? It's common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"Common Sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. Nope you're wrong."}

{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"How can you say that about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Islam is a religion without clergy, I doubt that a foreign mastermind imposes women, especially French women, to wear the veil."}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!","CN":"I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people."}
{"HS":"Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims.","CN":"This is not true."}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"7 Muslim Nobel Peace Prize winners would say otherwise."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"No, on the contrary Islam promotes the love of his neighbor, a Muslim or not. Simply human."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"No. Discriminatory speech against a religion does."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Our Constitution thankfully forbids any form of physical violence against criminals. Castration, being an extreme form of violence, cannot be practiced in our state."}
{"HS":"He has found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam.","CN":"I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims."}
{"HS":"We must eliminate this cult of hate and its supporters. Their literature is all about genocide and hate. Wake up Britain!","CN":"In fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. The literature teaches people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. Hence, I do not think we should eradicate the literature."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"This is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-Muslims would you?"}

{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"White men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the Church and Hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. Why aren't you angry about that?"}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Why do you define them like that? Explain better."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Many removed their veil to work."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am a Muslim. It is my religion. I am French. It is my country, 2 different things."}

{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You cannot force others to your own choices, mind your clothes."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"Maybe it is not that they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures."}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"If we throw bombs and commit violence it's impossible to reach a final and peaceful solution, only new conflicts will be generated."}
{"HS":"There should be no Mosque in this country. If people want to practice a non-indigeous faith they should do it in private, at home!!","CN":"You seem to be suggesting only Christians should be allowed a place of worship?"}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Excuse me, but what do you mean? Have you seen the latest figures? Http:\/\/www.healthdesk.it\/scenari\/non-vero-che-portano-malattie-miti-migranti-sfatati-dati."}

{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Can I suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the UK does not reflect 'our values' in the way I understand them."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"You know, I spoke with Muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating Christmas. Such a relief isn't it?"}

{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Let's hope they call good architects, my parish seems a huge garage of concrete."}
{"HS":"Our government has allowed this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they?","CN":"Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Your statistics are not right, where did you get them? Why skew the stats to focus on Muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped."}

{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. Https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-43200968."}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"Invasion? Don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? People simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world!"}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? It's common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"Yes you can. Bigotry is bigotry."}
{"HS":"I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it!","CN":"Would you say the same if this was about, say, Tibetan Buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion?"}

{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc.","CN":"#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church.

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Miserable comment!"}

{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"How about a constructive approach to solving problems? Violence is never the answer! Nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Wrong, try to be around Muslims and you'll see."}

{"HS":"Islam is a plague infecting our planet.","CN":"Dare to explain why? I see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Islam isn't incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. How many Muslims have you met that were rapists\/murderers\/had slaves?"}

{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"Are you serious?"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance."}
{"HS":"If white British men were raping muslim girls, they would be already in jail or murdered. Why double standards and privileges for Muslims?","CN":"Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community."}
{"HS":"Great Britain is not Great anymore, it is a shadow of its former self because of the cancer which is an islamic invasion.","CN":"Can I ask you what bad things Islam has brought to us? I cannot name any!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Islam is love for those who want to take it."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam advocates universal values of sharing love, respect and tolerance, just as the Republic from there on is full of compatibility, do not talk about themes that you see that you do not master."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Your question is the basis of malicious ideas that can break the cohesion of citizens."}
{"HS":"In Islam they stone people, especially adulterers.","CN":"Hi, the Koran contains no instruction on stoning, much less on adultery. Those who commit these acts go against the same religion that they claim to be inspired."}
{"HS":"Muslims in China were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol during the recent Chinese New Year celebration - At least China is doing it right!!","CN":"Aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? Whatever happened to 'British values'?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Which party?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe?"}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Criminal liability is personal, a whole category cannot pay for the errors of few."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"France does not think it is a problem to exploit, belittle or massacre its Muslim colonies."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This kind of comment is an overgeneralization, like many has been provided in history."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"There are French Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"In every community, there are always extremists, but it is not exclusive to Islam, and this is contrary to its message."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is an issue in France because politicians are trying constantly to control it, while stating everywhere that women MUST dress as they wish. Isn't it a paradox?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https:\/\/ind.pn\/2GHjGn7."}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Sorry I must have missed that episode of grand designs, link?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Stupid generalizations, serious and dangerous."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"I understand the fear that all these dramatic events in recent years have caused, but you can never respond to violence with more violence or generalizations of this type."}
{"HS":"Whether you accept it or not, people are concerned with Islamic rape gangs and the spread of extremism.","CN":"People's concerns must be based on evidence and not hatred."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Why are you talking in their places?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You are reducing the richness of this religion to an interpretation rather than questioning if it is only through your media."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is because you do not know women LOL."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Leave them at peace, they are beautiful, brilliant and above all free to wear the veil, everyone takes care of herself and is free to respect laws."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The perception of security often does not reflect reality, it is not true that immigrants commit more murders of Italians."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Excuse me, but to send them back with the boats would be necessary for the traffickers, it is perhaps not the best idea."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The headscarf is in no way an object of submission and in no way an obligation. It is a thoughtful choice and one that many people have accepted."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Speaking of invasion isn't very correct, considering the number of people who have settled permanently in Italy after they arrived in recent years. Our law guarantees the right of everyone to live their culture in freedom: this is the definition of enrichment: bringing something that was not there, that can teach something new."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It is not true that we maintain them. Only some asylum seekers (a small group)."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. When a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. We need to combat violent acts in all their forms. If we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"You should read less novels of political fiction. The idea that Muslims want to kill all the Christians is meaningless."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is a choice to work."}
{"HS":"They will blow all of us up.","CN":"I do not think it is in their interest."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Finally we recognize the Muslims in France."}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British\/Asian. Seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives."}
{"HS":"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.","CN":"Where did you get this conclusion from? There might be bias in the collecting of information. For example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"At present, the only terrorism is state terrorism. I will not mention the great world power that has granted itself the right to life and death on the entire planet or even some rogue murderous colonial oriental states."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"If a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. The vast majority of Muslims support people's right to freedom of religion."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Answering to violence with violence is not a solution."}
{"HS":"Thousands of British girls are raped, enslaved or murdered by Muslims and other non-British immigrants. Woe to thee!","CN":"This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics show that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"#visitmychurch are you going into Churches and asking the same questions of the clergy?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They are subject to God and they wear the veils freely."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Though looking at your tweet, I think what is left would be worse."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"I do not believe that they are replacing us, because in Italy the Islamic religion population is only 4%. Women can choose to wear the veil or not, and only the most radical forms of Islam require the use of the burqa."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Who said spare the cane spoils the child? How many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? Sounds like an issue in the western world."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The organizations of healthcare have not launched any alarm about the reappearance of eradicated diseases."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Islam advocates the value of subsistence obtained through the fruit of its labour."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"But do you know this religion or a Muslim? Do you know that many Italians are muslim too? And it does not seem to me that they are all lethal terrorists."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is of course compatible with the republic. Most Muslims are completely involved in society in various and varied organizations such as associations of parents of students in neighborhoods where others living together is very important."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Change obsession."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"So they steal the work of the French by staying at home! And instead of funding scientific research to understand such power, you are alienating it?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"How is it a submission to hide your attire?"}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Do you know, according to UK's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. This was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. Around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on.","CN":"You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!"}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Because we believe in freedom of religion here. Why should it bother anyone else for Muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others?"}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Are you comparing men to the beasts only because they have a different culture from you?"}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"I would not call them troglodytes. Think that Arabs are the founders of algebra, chemistry and modern medicine."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Which country should I return to? I am French. If you know of a country called Islamland or Islamistan, please let me know."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I understand that I do not represent your feminine ideal, but know that this veil is my pride."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"Wow! Offending Muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? What made you so angry?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Provide positive news story regarding Mulsims."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Why do you think Islam is evil? The major beliefs in Islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. For instance, they teach people to respect the lands and all creatures."}
{"HS":"Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact!","CN":"Britain Muslims means they are Britishes who enjoy the right covered by the Act. It is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"The first universities in Europe were established by Muslims. Muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' Europe."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Hi, his statement is very strong, could you explain better what you mean by 'replace in our house'?"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The republic is blind. It is not suitable for making a religion compatible."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"You should look more closely at the Muslim religion."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"How exactly are Muslims oppressing other cultures? Do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all Muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Generalizing is always wrong. I also condemn those who commit certain crimes, but regardless of their religious beliefs or their nationality."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Let us not turn the tables. Everything is prohibited for the veiled women."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Who requires the construction of mosques is not interested in competing with those who go to church, but simply in creating a place to practice their religion."}
{"HS":"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.","CN":"The Islamists are not all dangerous, indeed: the violent represent only a small part of a religion that makes the love of God and the brotherhood of man its fundamental basis."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known Doctors and Professors."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your comment, on the other hand, is aggressive because it places your well-being beyond my freedom without any justification."}
{"HS":"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists.","CN":"Criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. Doesn't matter what their race is. Why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The presence of mosques does not threaten our religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"There is no such thing as Musulmania to emigrate to."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent."}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Muslims 'believe' in Jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either."}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Have you actually spoken with Muslim about this? Do people celebrating Christmas actually offend them? I would be keen to know."}
{"HS":"Don't the Moslem's Holy books say 'kill infidels wherever they may be hiding'.","CN":"No, that is a misunderstanding. Actually they denounce violence."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Even Christians have gone through phases in which they tried to annihilate opponents and still a handful of enthusiasts, cannot make you judge all of them."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"The truth is that the majority of Muslim(s) involved in the social fabric of their neighborhood."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"This is not true: Islam is an Abrahamic religion like Christianity and Judaism, even though with a different tradition, and does not profess violence."}
{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"The only cover up I remember was in the Catholic Church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Islam does not impose the veil, it is always linked to the choice of women, as well as becoming a nun or priest or remain virgin until marriage."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"The only way to be sure of what you are saying is to meet a Muslim and talk to him about it and it will change your state of hope."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"A true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What values are you talking about because the values of Islam are fully compatible with the values of the republic."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Napalm. And they are the terrorists?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"From time to time, opening a history book about something other than Napoleon, Charlemagne or Louis XIV does not hurt. And would also give a better idea of the complexity and richness of the world."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. There are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project)"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"According to the CEOP, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'Type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. By your standard, we should get rid of them too."}
{"HS":"If you practice a non-indigenous faith, you are allowed to pray only in your home. Stop building mosques!","CN":"You seem to be suggesting only Christians should be allowed a place of worship?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"You accuse them of terrorism and of wanting to conquer with violence and bombs, and then propose yourself violence and bombs . I do not think this will lead to something positive."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"So would the Bible, the Torah, etc."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Already what is the definition of those words."}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"On the contrary, the principle of secularism of the French Republic protects every individual who wants to freely practice his confession."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Think this is a sign of your ignorance."}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"The Koran does not command this."}
{"HS":"Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law.","CN":"Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here."}
{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"Are you suggesting we should not be democratic? Or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. Perhaps we should try nepotism?"}
{"HS":"They are beasts, they keep their women at home and under the veil, then they go out and rape ours.","CN":"It does not appear to me that there is data to support this theory."}
{"HS":"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.","CN":"I suggest you see what the atomic bombs have made on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Do you really want this to happen again?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Christians, go to the Vatican. Jews, go to Palestine. Buddhists go to India! Everyone should live his religion where he was born."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"Well, but we can choose the color .! What's your favorite?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Who was Avvero\ufffd\ufffd? Manzoni says this in his romance \"The Betrothed'. Avvero\ufffd\ufffd was a sage, philosopher and also a worthy exponent of the Islamic world when in the West heretics were burned."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Try running the NHS without them and other migrants!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Submission to God."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"The Bible, the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?"}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"This is not true. Why do you think this?"}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!"}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"But it is also true that the respect is given to all and is free!"}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Really? It is contrary to the principles of Muslims to take advantage of a failure!"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"We'll have to open a Koran before speaking in the name of Islam and especially during review your history."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"When you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but I isn't Islam one of the worlds major religions."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"You speak without knowing."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Fake! Absolutely wrong! Tolerance, respect, wisdom and peace among other things are the values"}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"Perhaps to wish death at people is not the right approach to use."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"This speech might also be perceived as a kind of attack on intelligence and openness."}
{"HS":"In Italy is taking place a real religious replacement.","CN":"The majority of immigrants in Italy is Catholic."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"If we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left?"}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"Rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. This is an abhorrent individual."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Reasoning by contradiction: Muslims are over one billion on earth, more than 4 million in France. If this assertion were true, there would otherwise be more victims!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I'm not French?"}
{"HS":"Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice before it is too late!","CN":"There is nothing to raise your voice to. Have you ever spoken to your local Muslim community?"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith who adds so much to society?"}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"The coexistence and knowledge of Islamic culture can only enrich us and make us less ignorant, not leading to a historical recurrence."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"French of Portuguese origin converted to Islam."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"And the Christian veil? Is it an apology for ku kux klan?"}
{"HS":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","CN":"I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?"}
{"HS":"There can never be peace wherever there is Islam.","CN":"Iceland and Switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'Global Peace index'. Both have Muslim populations."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"They were not hiring precisely because they are veiled."}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"Have you read Qu'ran? Do you know what it states? I suppose not. How can you then judge the statements there?"}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be in their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"An answer like that so indiscriminate seems not a solution to me to migration; people that arrive in Italy are not here to 'conquer' us, they come to try to have a better future."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Islamic terrorists actually are not very religious, they are second generation, grown in the absence of values"}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"What would Jesus say? I do not think He would be preaching intolerance and Hate!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The submission of the woman is these words made by uneducated people."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I'm fine in my head and it hurts you in yours, weird no!"}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"There's a few people I do not want here but deporting British Citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship."}

{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"No, clearly."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. That is what we should be stopping."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"How can you say this about 1.6 billion people?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Off topic."}
{"HS":"These 8 crooks are all Muslims and every one of their victims is Non-Muslim, white-British. Why do these criminals only target White British Non-Muslims?","CN":"Tosh! Criminals are 'equal opportunists', targeting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity."}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"Generalizing never brings anything good: the violent are just a fraction of all Muslims."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"How many Muslims have you met in your life to be able to make this kind of judgment?"}

{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Many of the current countries with a Muslim majority have been beacons of civilization, just think of the vital contribution made by Arab culture to our development in all sectors, including mathematics, astronomy, literature etc ."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Excluding some citizens is a way to subdue citizens."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is a peaceful religion, not fanaticism. Isis is fanaticism, and I would like to point out that the first victims are Muslims."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there have been knife and gun issues over the last 20 years."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Provide examples of those in the muslim community working."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Did you know that Muslims introduced universities to Europe? So the knowledge Western societies are built on."}
{"HS":"Islam is a plague infecting our planet.","CN":"Clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.Why so negative?"}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Muslims do not steal your job."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Wow! Offending Muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? What made you so angry?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I invite you to inform yourself better and you will notice that Muslims are human beings like us. They will not bring us back to the Middle Ages, indeed they will enrich our culture."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Where is this misconception coming from?"}
{"HS":"If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance!","CN":"Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Every religion has its extremists interpreters, which fortunately do not represent it and they are actually a minority."}
{"HS":"He has found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam.","CN":"Who are 'all'? You cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude."}
{"HS":"I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!","CN":"It is increasingly widespread the belief that there is a close link between Islam and terrorism. Actually, the Koran speaks more about peace than war, more about rights than bans."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"They create spaces to practice their religion, I do not think that would bother the Catholics that already have their spaces."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"There is a confusion. Secularism means that the state does not have an official religion, but citizens have the choice of religion and to manifest it; the state is the guarantor of these liberties. So wearing the veil is a freedom fully guaranteed by law."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Freedom is frightening. The one who wears the veil is a proof of it."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"These statements stigmatize the citizens of this religion."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The republic by definition guarantees freedom of worship."}
{"HS":"Islam hates women.","CN":"Islam values women in many ways: respect for the mother, the right to inheritance, the right to dispose of one's property without the consent of one's husband, equality with men before God."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"If I annoy you, you can look away."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Have you ever spoken to a muslim?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Did you study Islam?"}
{"HS":"Why must Islam invade every country? That is just totalitarian. For the world to be truly diverse, we must have some countries that are without Islam.","CN":"I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spread of a particular faith or belief, but isn't' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Being Muslim is a spirituality, the spirit is omnipresent."}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"And views like that, that lumps all Muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is an act of love and obedience to Allah."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Islam has given many things to the Western society. For example, medicine, mathematics. These things belong with our society. It is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Do you know what the percentage of Muslims in France is?"}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Terrorism is not confined to one particular religion."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"How would you feel if I were to say to you that your cap is an aggression against me ?"}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"Hi, could you explain better what you mean?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Ahh yes. It is true, the media tries somehow to exclude us from all spaces. We are too visible! We still have the streets and social networks."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"What harm does it make to you? Do you spend so much energy to defend the right to accommodation for families on the street?"}
{"HS":"Our national flag cannot be shown as it could annoy a Muslim.#fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"If that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? Should we report the Queen next time she is home?"}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Define western society? Who chooses this?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Can you feel attacked by a piece of cloth? It is my veil and it is on my head, you are free to go your way."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Can you not see how offensive this is? Just replace what you said with any other group of people."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"There is no proven correlation between disease and immigration."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is a religion devoted to love for one's fellow, jihad is a minority not related to religion."}
{"HS":"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.","CN":"You aren't seriously suggesting that only Muslims are rapists?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"All Muslims? That is a bit of an exaggeration I would say. Do not blame an entire community for actions of a few."}
{"HS":"It is time for us to take Islam for what it is. A murderous cult that should be exterminated, and that is the end of it.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred."}
{"HS":"Ultimately, the Muslims want to either convert us or kill us.","CN":"Islam does not impose anything to anyone!"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"What about agoraphobic people?"}
{"HS":"I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!","CN":"Generalizing is not right and does not lead to anything good: explaining what is the faith of over a billion and a half people living in very different cultural contexts is complicated. Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, but some persons give a wrong and extremist reading to it. The pillars of Islam are the declaration of faith of monotheism, the prayer, the alms, the fasting during the month of Ramadan, the pilgrimage to La Mecca."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The pillars of Islam does not preach the imposition of religion, indeed they preach co-existence of religions and tolerance. The majority of Muslim foreigners arrive in Italy, because they fled from the country of origin for war and\/or persecution conditions. It would be cruel to send them back there."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"Nobody deserves to be discriminated against, regardless of his confession, sex or otherwise. Thank you."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. I could go on."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"By far the vast majority of the violence is the work of Italians. Among foreign immigrants, on top of the list are the Romanians, namely community non-Muslim citizens. So what you say is wrong."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"With us these also with you."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"We should question the women themselves that we almost never questioned."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"Oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"False Muslims meet like all their fellow citizens throughout their journey, all come out of people at school at work who are places of socialization. They move away from hateful people and stigmatization of course. And discrimination can lead them to exclude themselves for fear of confrontation."}
{"HS":"If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance!","CN":"After tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? And, most importantly, violence does not solve anything."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"How have you come to this conclusion?"}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Western Society seems pretty incompatible with Western Society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from Indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Then I can say that \"all the Germans are Nazis.\"."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You're right, and I also noticed that most of them are gas or heating pump operators."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Ironically, I think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack Muslims. Intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too."}
{"HS":"\"islamophobia\" is a way to take away our freedom of expression.","CN":"Islamophobia is a disease like any racism."}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"I have met so many Muslim people adhering to British values. What do you base your view on?"}
{"HS":"Jihadi Bride wants to return to the UK now that Isis is defeated. She gave up all rights when she joined the terrorists. Let her rot in a camp in Raqqa!!","CN":"This isn't really about the class as such, more about a country's responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"For the vast majority it is a personal choice."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Can you provide me the source from which did you deduce this statement?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"And kippah is political Judaism."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Punishing the 'Many' for the sins of the 'Few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"1. Why should Muslims impose their beliefs? 2. Women are not obliged to wear the veil. It is a free choice."}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"I would not say the many Muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. Generalised hate like this, however, is."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"What do you base your view on?"}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"When 400,000 Muslims died in WW1 for Britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided."}
{"HS":"I wish all of them would die.","CN":"Could you please explain your theory on this subject? How can you make such an act?"}
{"HS":"The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult!","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Try running the NHS without them and other migrants!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is my freedom."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"It is a myth that is prevalent in identity settings, don't worry."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified."}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Saying that all people of a certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all."}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"Do you think a Muslim would forget to capitalise the I in Islam?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"They are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild our civilization after the war."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is the majority in Mayotte, very present in Reunion Island. Does that mean that the inhabitants are not doing well?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Don't worry: Islam is not contagious. On the other hand, misunderstandings certainly are. We must absolutely eradicate them. To do so, do not hesitate to open up to others and get informed by visiting our site. Your health will only improve."}
{"HS":"A woman who accepts to live hidden under a veil and gets beaten by her man does not deserve to live in a civilized country like Italy.","CN":"Reading comments of women who can write such nasty statements is even sadder."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"There is no invasion, the Muslim population in Italy does not exceed 5%."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The law prohibits requiring the wearing of a veil. If they do not file a complaint, it is because they do so voluntarily."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"Sorry I must have missed that episode of grand designs, link?"}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"So what about Muslims born in the UK whose national flag is the Union Jack?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Secularism is a religion, did you know that? So make enquiries before saying anything."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Fgm is not widely practised in Muslim countries like Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan. It is a cultural thing, many Muslims do not do it."}
{"HS":"Islam opposes creativity, since all that is needed is the Koran. It is not a religion, but a system of control.","CN":"Don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control?"}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment in many places for a very long time, not just in Muslim culture. Plus, the society has not changed too much. The most important thing is how we can make the society and the world a better place, not just excluding others."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your word is an aggression against my religion."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Oh, yeah? Forgive me, but how did he attack you? I'm going to hand him over to the police and I'll take TELINDUS with you against him!"}
{"HS":"I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam.","CN":"How many times have you seen evangelical Christian preachers and followers on the streets most Saturdays in most UK cities? You do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This is 99% of the time a personal choice."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"According to the law, irregular immigrants can be repatriated, regardless of ethnicity (in this case, however, not on the boats, clearly). By what principle of law should be repatriated an Arab with a valid permit?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"It is bullshit."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"Muslims are just like other human groups, honest in most cases."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?"}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent girls from wearing skirts.","CN":"The Muslim woman's clothing must be ample, just as it is a sign of modesty for men!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"If I want to live in the Middle Ages, that's my problem, isn't it?"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions."}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to control, Muslims must follow the Koran, they cannot do anything else. Islam does not give space to creativity and freedom.","CN":"Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Watch out that the victims are not only us, but all those who are forced to leave their country and to seek shelter and refuge here, also it seems to me that she is enormously generalizing."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"The impression of Islamization comes from the over-mediatization of Islam. Today is like putting a spot on Islam when this religion has existed for more than 1500 years and no one was talking about it."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"France is the only country that seeks to exclude women from society."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"The freedom of some ends where the freedom of others begins."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"I do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy?"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"People invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. Doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that I am familiar with."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it."}
{"HS":"If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and \/ or at war?","CN":"The golden age of Islam existed."}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!","CN":"Sexualization of children is a modern value? Do you actually know what is meant by values?"}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"All the people from Pakistan that I know are really nice! No need to generalize too much!"}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Have you thought about what western value is what Islam is really about?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?","CN":"Have you heard about the Arab Counter-Terrorism Coalition?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Media: divide!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Could you define one of these words rigorously?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"How will they limit our food and will it increase diseases?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"I do not know any Muslim who raped non-muslim women."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators."}
{"HS":"Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK!","CN":"Eradicating these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"So-called civilised Europe has benefited from Islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that Muslims have just as much right as any other to be here."}
{"HS":"Islam is a plague infecting our planet.","CN":"Hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorism is a serious problem but it has nothing to do with religion."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"Are you suggesting that the 'Prevent' programme is about appeasement to Islam, Hadaway bonnie lad."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I do not feel controlled by anyone. What about you?"}
{"HS":"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites.","CN":"Have you heard about the Arab Counter-Terrorism Coalition?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The only ones who have proposed to me their religion were Jehovah's Witnesses, I said no thanks and they went away. I never experienced 'constraints.'."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"I have so many amazing Muslim friends. I do not want them deported. What is your reasoning?"}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"If it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. What about Christianity and colonialism?"}
{"HS":"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape.","CN":"You aren't seriously suggesting that only Muslims are rapists?"}
{"HS":"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?","CN":"Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"I thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. Now you advocate exporting people without a trial or a conviction."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Could you enlighten me on the following definitions: fundamentalist \/ Islamist and Salafist."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"If well worn, the veil can be very elegant."}
{"HS":"Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK!","CN":"Where exactly do you put people you remove from the UK, when they are from the UK?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The rapist is a typical Italian product, I would say."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It does not appear to me that there are correlations between the Islamic faith and the fact of being affected by a disease."}
{"HS":"Shocking. 2 men are murdered in Paris by having their throats cut by some savage shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and the BBC ignore the story. Another cover up.","CN":"Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"What does it mean?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Seriously, I would love to know where you get your statistics from. They are so far from the truth."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"Although, in June 2018, for example, more than 2,000 Afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an Islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in Afghanistan is forbidden under the Islamic law'. So clearly not all Muslim clerics are warmongers."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Muslims are largely integrated."}
{"HS":"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?","CN":"Evidence?"}
{"HS":"A third of Britons think that Islam and British values are incompatible because there is a fundamental clash.","CN":"Did anyone identify what 'British values' are, or are we all still just making it up as we go along. I am still holding out for 'Religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this?"}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"The Qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. That sounds quite compatible with science to me."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Your comments are racist and are subject to criminal sanctions."}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Even the Muslims have the right to practice their religion."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? Really?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Saying 'Arabs' is a generalization and does not indicate a religion."}
{"HS":"Our government has allowed this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they?","CN":"The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advice or solutions."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What is an aggression to you is not the veil but the choice to wear it or not."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"How about a constructive approach to solving problems? Violence is never the answer! Nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Your answer is too Manichean. We live in a world of nuance. Perhaps there is a tiny part of it that is part of it just as will go to Ireland or the farc in Colombia or other African Christian groups are part of it. This is not the hallmark of Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"We rape our women, actually."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It is the policies that have made it complicated with laws that have neither head nor tail."}
{"HS":"How can we fight anti-Semitism when city ghettos of Birmingham, Bradford, etc. Are full of anti-Semitic Pakistani muslims? Labour is lost to the mix of Radical Islam\/middle class.","CN":"It is funny how lots of Jewish and Muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example)"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Are you sure about this? Have you interviewed every single person in this country? Tell me more about this."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"And that comes from where you think it comes from."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Hate really? Even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the Manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. See where I am going?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"For me not every one of us can live his liver without any problem."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"I almost would like it. As a woman, I can say: a great saving on cosmetic products."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The Muslim religion is not to be feared because it is different from ours. We have to work for integration."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"The Muslim community is unanimously sided against religious extremism, which is not part of their religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Why? The Muslims I know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion?"}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"Muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. It does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Some horrible people are responsible for this. But why assign a religion to this? It has nothing to do with it."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Isis is an extrem of Islam and does not represent Muslims' belief and action. Indeed, most of Islam condemned the action of ISIS."}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Hi, it seems fundamental to me to differentiate between those who commit heinous crimes in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their faith in a peaceful manner and respectful of other cultures, which happens in most cases."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This is amplified by the news."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"Secularism by definition guarantees the right to practice whatever religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"If it wasn't for a Muslim I would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Much like your statement then."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise."}
{"HS":"These 8 criminals are all Muslims because their victims are always white or Non-Muslim!","CN":"Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?"}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are respectable, your words are not."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"It seems like you are against Muslims if you are saying something like this? Why is that?"}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent people from eating during Ramadan.","CN":"Fasting is a personal choice."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"The wealth of a country is its mixing if you can't stand it, then return to your country as an intolerant person."}
{"HS":"It is one law for Muslims and another law for us.","CN":"Yes, as well as everything non-Muslims aren't allowed to do by law, Muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"What do you think it is then?"}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"From what I have heard, clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully, so I am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? Plus, this is not a way to be."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is one of the minority religions in this country and it is sustainably so. To believe that there is an extra-terrestrial plot to Islamize France is a pure delusion. A large proportion of French Muslims are of immigrant origin. Parents and grandparents were brought in as cheap and docile labours. It turns out that they were also largely Muslims and attached to their religious practice. And their children and grandchildren are also the vast majority."}
{"HS":"These Muslims now want also to impose their food, only they should eat couscous! I want my children to eat pork meat, which is good for them.","CN":"Hello, actually the couscous is also linked to our tradition, especially in south Italy and it is not a matter to impose a practice typical of another religion. Many food experts have recommended the introduction of this food (still a free choice) in school canteens because it is considered a suitable food for healthy nutrition."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"So all the priests are pedophiles and all the Germans are Nazis."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"If they were locked up, we wouldn't have all these discussions because we wouldn't see so many veils."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are already in our country."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Your arguments are against freedom of worship."}
{"HS":"Muhammad married Aisha when she was only 9 years old.","CN":"Arranged marriages with children are no longer accepted by the Muslim community, but in any case these were not consummated even in antiquity until the child did not reach adulthood."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Do you know that the religion that has proselytized most of all in the world, since the time of its foundation was Christianity?"}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. Cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and living in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting!","CN":"Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes."}
{"HS":"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.","CN":"You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of mosques in Italy is totally insignificant."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"These are the wrong images that frighten you."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"I understand the fear linked to these horrendous crimes, but they should be condemned regardless of nationality."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Violence is actually more common in the Bible than in the Qur'an. (link to Independent article about analysis of both books finding this). That noted, violence exists within and without religion."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"You obviously do not understand what mental illness is? Why do not you read up on some psychology?"}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"You are aware there are millions of Muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it."}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"This is a very sad story! But every Muslim person I know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the Qu'ran."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Racist comments."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Saying that the Arabs want to impose their religion is wrong also as a concept: not all Arabs are Muslims, some are Christians like many Italians."}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Islam is the source of truth."}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam is a plague infecting our planet.","CN":"Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. Perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"All people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any Western society."}
{"HS":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","CN":"Evidence?"}
{"HS":"Muslims force their child to fast during Ramadan.","CN":"It is for their religious purpose."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"So you also agree with castration of all the husbands \/ boyfriends \/ violent fellows that have Italian origin?"}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"There is never justification for rape. Individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. They carry the blame."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"To ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more than a bit unfair?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims have been around longer than some."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!?"}
{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"What do you mean by 'islamized'? If mosques are built in some areas, I do not see this as a threat but as representation of community in those areas?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"There is a general return to faith."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"A true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I have friends who are refugees and they have rights such as the right to study. They've never killed anyone."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Another idea from the 1950s that immigration lives on the back of France, where veiled women are represented in all trades (lawyers, doctors, accountants, etc.)"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"A very small percentage of Muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. Cant generalize it to Muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of Islam."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"I do not understand why you perceive this risk. Although some Muslims want to do that, we have a democratic state that protects us. We don't need to invent problems that do not exist."}
{"HS":"Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail.","CN":"This isn't. This is a false dichotomy. All crime and hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"It appears I cannot criticize islam for being a cult which encourages wars and takes over host nations by any means justified by their scriptures. Can I critisize them for being intolerant, biased, sexist and chauvinist?","CN":"What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blamed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?"}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"British Muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and\/or example of one large charity donation from a Mosque], so I am struggling to see the problem with Mosques where these funds are mostly raised."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Nowhere in the Koran is said to use violence against the infidels."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Only in France there is a problem with Muslims. For example in England there is no problem with Muslims."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Hospitality is not always the best, and for some hotheads, we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, because no one is blameless. For example, exploiters of people, gangsters and criminals also of our nationality."}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"Your words are full of hatred and violence, don't you think it is dangerous for human beings to keep putting us against each other for some contrasting positions when there would be a thousand reasons to live in brotherhood?"}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by US and UK intelligence agencies. Are you sure it is Muslims we need to be worried about?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Why? And is kippah politic?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. Ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream Islam and happened 15 years ago."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The frequency of violence is related to social status more than to religion. Inclusion and social differences are a basic bigger problem from which derive these problems."}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"Can I suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Nothing to do with it."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"That's not true, we are Muslims, which means submission to the Lord. The latter is good and commands us to do only good."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Wearing the veil is a choice for the majority of women."}
{"HS":"Our government has allowed this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they?","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"They simply demonstrate modesty."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?"}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Really? For every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This is because you do not have the right frames."}
{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth."}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"Wisdom has no age."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Show me evidence of this?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @POTUS maybe he is a closet muslim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"All trees are fetid goosefoot."}
{"HS":"Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate.","CN":"Please check this [https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2016\/aug\/01\/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research]"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, I am one of such people and nobody forced me to wear it. That said, unfortunately in some countries with authoritarian regimes women do not have the freedom to choose (Iran or Saudi Arabia), they may be verbalized and are outlawed for having decided to choose for themselves how to dress. Women who choose to veil in France undergo the same type of treatment."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"This statement is very cruel. Can you tell me if you strongly believe in this statement? Where does all this anger come from?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The Sufis are Islamic, a particularly loving trend and linked to the arts such as music, dance and poetry. Nothing to do with murder."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Actually, this survey of Muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/voices\/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Good evening, whom are you talking about specifically?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Allah requires everyone to love his neighbor."}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"What do you mean? What point are you making?"}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"I do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The problem is not Muslims, but the chauvinist mentality that we Italians are soaked with, which sees the woman as an object."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Kkk anyone? Actions of an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"I do not see any mosque."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Are we talking about everyone's intentions? What are yours? Personally, I do not intend to establish a 'caliphate' in France, I have other things to do. #JePeuxPasJ'aiPiscine."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is a garment like any other, secularism does not impose any way of dressing, but preaches respect for everyone and protects everyone's freedom in this choice."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women can decide whether or not to wear it based on their degree of Faith and resistance to verbal and physical aggression by ignorant people."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Imagine that I am there in my country."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me."}
{"HS":"There can never be peace wherever there is Islam.","CN":"According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank which has produced the Global Peace index for the past 10 years, only Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Qatar, Switzerland, Uruguay and Vietnam are free from conflict. Qatar has a sizable number of followers of Islam apparently."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"British literature has been influenced by Islamic writing for hundreds of years, even Shakespeare included Muslim characters. [link to Othello wiki with example]."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"The quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. Jihadists do not represent the islamic faith."}

{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"I mean, I am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"The majority of Muslims live together peacefully with Christians without creating any problem. Terrorists in most cases were not even practicing Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"Report to True Vision online. I am sure you know it's illegal to discriminate by colour. But something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story."}

{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"About simplistic."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016\/17. But I am guessing, not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?"}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Not all french are drunk."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Thanks to you! For some people unfortunately."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is a personal choice in response to a religious belief. Why don't we wonder if the nuns are covering themselves for political purposes?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Wrong. The school of the republic teaches us tolerance and living together. I had the chance to spend a few years there."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion."}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"Before making judgement, do you understand what Islam and its history are?"}
{"HS":"They impose on us their culture.","CN":"I think that they try to keep their identity and I do not see anything wrong with it, where their customs conflict with ours we create space for dialogue."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"We must encourage the encounter between different cultures."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Personally I'd like to deepen the Islamic culture, as well as others with which we are and will increasingly be in contact. I think it would be helpful to be all less ignorant in the interests of peaceful coexistence."}

{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Integration is the solution. We invest in integration policies."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. It is no more prevalent in Muslim communities."}

{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is a religion, not fanaticism. There is who hides behind it to perform horrific acts, but this does not mean that anyone who professes it is a murderer."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!"}

{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Explain? Such offensive language and diversity is a strength."}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"Hi, do you really think that we can generalize against all Muslims? Most of them profess their faith in a way that is peaceful and respects cultures and faiths of the other. Do they really deserve to be equated with those who claim to profess a faith and then not follow it?"}
{"HS":"Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery was widely dominant before Islam. Muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness."}
{"HS":"I think is common sense to have prejudice about Islam. This isn't racism because Islam is a cult.","CN":"Common Sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. Nope you're wrong."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggests that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religious affiliation at all."}

It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women.","CN":"Today, in many Muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. For example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc."}

{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Italy has a laic constitution. The hypothesis of imposition of the veil seems to me a provocation."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"There is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of Islam just like Christianity and Judaism."}

We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Terrorism is a widespread phenomenon in the world, among Arab, European, American and many Asian and African peoples.

{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Why am I here then?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"This implies an organized network with a political or even commercial organization, yet Islam is a religion, no one can be forced to join it."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy!"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"What do you mean by the term 'Arabs'? If you refer to professors of the Islamic faith, they do not necessarily coincide with the inhabitants of Arab countries, given that minorities of Christians also live in these countries."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"I do not support this. If we go back to the beginning of terrorism, the initiators were not Muslims."}
{"HS":"Minister, do not hide! We must fight Islam that causes terror and crisis!","CN":"Can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? I do not see it in our society."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Don't you think that there are also women who are forced to wear \"sexy clothes\" against their will? Or clothes of this or that cut? Or this and that color?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Hi, do you really believe that those who commit violence in the name of an alleged religious faith, can be considered a true believer? Can we equate people who kill fellow citizens with those who live their lives regularly and peacefully?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"My country is France. I contribute fully to its growth and development."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"It seems to me that you throw the baby out with the bathwater. Fanatics and thugs are everywhere, but that's not enough to say that all of them are!"}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"Have you seen Magaluf in the summer? Brits do the same everywhere we go."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"It sounds like you are saying that you have to be Christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think?"}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"If we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories of the 1970's, for example, it's a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grandkids as an invasion or a plague, don't you think?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Many people do not apply them, it does not pose a problem?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"This is the political class supported by the media that makes it a problem."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"Good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-Muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. Oh, wait."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You do not have to validate my outfit as I do not have to validate yours."}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Women do not belong to no one but themselves and the best way to preserve them is to combat violence committed by men against them."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"I would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Muslims do have a place in Europe's multicultural society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."}

{"HS":"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites.","CN":"There are many examples of Muslims protesting against ISIS. Seriously, do a google search."}
{"HS":"Stop mosques, lairs of terrorists.","CN":"Allowing the construction of a mosque confers credit to us, it means respecting the other in all its diversity."}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"Today is widespread hostility against the Islamic religion, your words are the proof. In fact the Islamists are nothing more than people who follow and believe in a monotheistic religion that has at its base the love of God and the brotherhood, nothing less than the Christian religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"That is inaccurate, do your research! Slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"They said the same of Jews, Italian immigrants and history have proved them wrong. What part do you choose? In which way you want to be remembered? As someone who has helped those in trouble or as someone who caused the death of innocent people?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I do not see the link between Islamism and diseases."}
{"HS":"Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'.","CN":"The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The number of mosques is not even remotely comparable to the number of churches, let's not panic."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Positive news story about muslim community."}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"Are all major religions not religions of conquest to some extent? It does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening Christianity and Islam through their 'idea of conquest')"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Why do you want to politicize the veil in this way? The veil has been in France for centuries, a bit of history would help you."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Terrorism is contrary to Islam which tolerates only defensive wars and respect civilians."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"But who really are all these Muslims all over the world?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Since when has a people or a community been judged through the behaviour of a few misguided people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"There is no Muslim country."}
{"HS":"These 8 criminals are all Muslims because their victims are always white or Non-Muslim!","CN":"They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?"}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in 2017. Stop blaming others and help our girls and women."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"The Qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. That sounds quite compatible with science to me."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Provided the basis for all Western scientific and philosophical knowledge?"}
{"HS":"The migrants represent the 5th column.","CN":"Legal disclaimer."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Really? Hundreds of millions of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Diversity is an enrichment, do not try to impoverish France!"}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"Each person is free and for this motive it's not possible to impose obligations by force. Can you explain to me the reason for this statement?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Actually it is obligatory for praying, because in front of God you have to be covered."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"Where exactly do you put people you remove from the UK, when they are from the UK?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"The term Islamism was coined during colonization to designate those who were against the settlers and their policy of inhibiting Islam, especially in the Maghreb."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"There are a hundred similar images of Christian including those in the KKK standing next to their victims who used the Bible as a justification. Of course none of us believe they represent all Christians."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"Doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all British Citizens have? Freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'British values'."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Then we would be left with angry people like you. Doesn't seem to be the best plan."}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"The modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims.

{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"What do you base your view on?"}
{"HS":"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight.","CN":"What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principles is to respect human dignity. Islam condemns violence."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. Need I go on?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Criminals must be punished but not confused with the majority, who live with us peacefully."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"On what do you base your statement? I am also against human oppression. Let us ask them what it is all about and act if necessary."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"1. On what basis do you define this an invasion? 2. Can you explain your point of view?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims)."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Really? It seems to me that it is a comment a bit excessive."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"You mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers?"}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?"}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"Yes, I am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the Koran and learning about Islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. That makes sense."}

{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is possible to change sidewalks in a democracy."}
{"HS":"Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. )","CN":"Have you seen Magaluf in the summer? Brits do the same everywhere we go."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"Why Muslim men? Such a sweeping statement."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are very active, for example in associations."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil is a protection for the woman."}

{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"In my opinion, many people want to emigrate to London means London is a charming and enjoyable place for living. Isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"So you are constantly assaulted by nuns? What a horrible life."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Is it the compulsory acts of charity? Or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. Just which of those are you worried about?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I'm sorry, but you have to do some work on yourself."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"But can we keep the doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local takeaway, and my son's favourite teacher and I did enjoy getting all those gold medals last Olympics and others."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Unfortunately, violence against women is a cross fact that happens in every country, in every corner, and the victims are us, us women, so let's not make it an issue of nation, ethnicity, religion, a crime is a crime, whoever does it and castration does not really seem the solution to the problem."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I sense a heart full of hate. You would feel aggrieved by your shadow."}
{"HS":"Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything?","CN":"Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is a lack of knowledge of Muslim women."}

{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"If that were true would not there only be one version of Islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. Just like Christianity it has different interpretations, there are good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders."}
{"HS":"Muslims must integrate or leave France!","CN":"Forced integration with a desire for assimilation is a dictatorship criterion."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I do not understand how our welfare 'supports' the people. We try to give the possibility of integration to prevent that the exclusion will turn into delinquency, an event that is independent of the original culture."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"How will being angry and violent towards members of your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues?"}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"1000s of Muslims died in WW1 and 2 defending Britain, 1000s still in UK armed forces defending peace across the world. Bloody retribution on them, really?"}

{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"I think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities Islam shares with Christianity. It teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The Republic ended \"Catholic France,\" with secularism. Why would this principle be inoperative with Islam?"}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"It seems to me there is a lot of violence in your comment, can you do me the courtesy to explain the source of your hatred?"}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"Hi, do you really believe that a peaceful community, whose religion is based on love and brotherhood will lead to a historic recurrence?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The scarf is in no way a forced act. We just suffer from prejudice and ignorance. It is in no way an object that hinders freedom. It is good to work outside or travel with friends."}

Battisti, who in recent days has been arrested and others were, but they were still a handful of people when compared to the number of inhabitants of Italy, so we are wrong every time we throw the baby out with the bath water."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"This may reflect discrimination in hiring."}

{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Why is this a muslim issue? All people from all walks of life can be violent?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Well following his reasoning all Italians Catholics should also be castrated.

{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Sounds like incitement to me."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Apart from all those who use violence\/terrorism who are not Muslim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Maybe it is not that they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!"}

{"HS":"British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?","CN":"Our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. Does it mean that the government is submitting to them? To me it means being humane! You should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Do you even know what that means?"}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal.","CN":"To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith."}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"But you know, I could almost agree, provided that on the Italians that do the same thing, which is unfortunately a large group, it would be imposed the same penalty, and instead the Italian macho . But come on! Do you read newspapers that tell about violence on women and feminicide?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I do not think that there have been cases of Arabs who have attempted to fill positions of some power in Italy. So why do you say that they want to control us?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil is not a religious principle."}
{"HS":"Islam hates women.","CN":"Islam has raised the Woman. In Islam a woman is a treasure, a crystal that is sacred!"}
{"HS":"The mental problem that terrorists have in common is Islam! Muslims are crazy!","CN":"I agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other Muslim people!"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Arab countries have always condemned terrorist acts."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"You know all the Muslims, that must make the world?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative."}
{"HS":"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape.","CN":"Where did you get this conclusion from? There might be bias in the collecting of information. For example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"If that were really true why are there so few people saying it?"}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear."}
{"HS":"The migrants represent the 5th column.","CN":"No assistance to anyone in danger."}
{"HS":"Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything?","CN":"Are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the Indian sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories?"}
{"HS":"A recent poll confirm a thrid of Britons believe there is a 'fundamental clash' between Islam and 'British values'.","CN":"A reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"A veiled woman reflects modesty and that gives it value."}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"I think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"False, the veil is simply a sign of modesty."}
{"HS":"Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.","CN":"Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions."}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"Is it just words? Things I see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. To me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a European person or an immigrant. Also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is a divine obligation."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"In my experience, having known many Muslims, I must say that no one seemed particularly interested in organizing a coup to take power in Italy."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"It is impossible, the musulmanie was swallowed up long ago, the same time as Atlantis, located 2km further north."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Ignorance leads to hate."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"There is no Muslim problem, there are only human problems, Islam is a religion of positivity."}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"Where did you get this figure from? Might I get some real evidence for this? Because this seems very much unrealistic."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim!"}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"There is already work going within Muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If we were all terrorists, the world would no longer exist."}

{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims are simply interested in practicing their religion peacefully, we should not confuse them with the few extremists."}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"No, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"All the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children."}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"Muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the West which isn't present in Muslim majority countries."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am French and Muslim."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. It is no more prevalent in Muslim communities."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Maybe if you'd learned about Islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on.","CN":"Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Can you provide me with statistical studies on this subject?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Same shortcut as terrorists go."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You should read the definition of these terms or should I say read the definitions of these terms as you seem to be in total ignorance."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Do you know there are Muslims in British Army? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I'm certainly more patriotic than you."}
{"HS":"Islam purpose is only the conquest.","CN":"Are all major religions not religions of conquest to some extent? It does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening Christianity and Islam through their 'idea of conquest')"}

{"HS":"A recent poll confirm a thrid of Britons believe there is a 'fundamental clash' between Islam and 'British values'.","CN":"Did anyone identify what 'British values' are, or are we all still just making it up as we go along.

{"HS":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","CN":"Why Muslim men? Such a sweeping statement."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Islamophobic comments."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Stats show Muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. This kind of false sentiment only serves to fuel hate crime against Muslims."}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"Your answer seems dictated more by hatred than by rationality."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news."}

Why is the media ignoring this?","CN":"The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes."}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"Anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"All peoples have a place in every part of the world."}
{"HS":"Rape for them is natural, a part of their culture. The Somalis admitted it. Absurd! We should not help them!","CN":"These are wicked words. But if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Politics? Strangely, when mainstream political parties seek the Muslim electorate, we hear a completely different speech! Politics has nothing to do with it, the only connection that can be made is when a French Muslim is going to vote, but everyone fulfills his civic duty, an atheist, a Christian, or a Buddhist, or a Jew."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Islam is a religion similar to Christianity, as much open. The extremisms are present in all religions."}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys people's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Instead, the non-Muslims that kill them, which punishment must serve, as they often are on the loose but dangerous?"}
{"HS":"They want us to believe that this is normal, soon our little girls will be veiled.","CN":"These are our daughters, we have the choice to educate them as we wish."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Could you show me with precision to what diseases you refer?"}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to control, Muslims must follow the Koran, they cannot do anything else. Islam does not give space to creativity and freedom.","CN":"Don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The Quran does command Muslim rape gangs. In fact, sexual violation is regarded by true Muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The cross is political Christianity."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"If someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. But as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"No need to answer."}
{"HS":"Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam.","CN":"By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"And what should we do with the bigots and racists?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"No this is a prejudice born after the attacks."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This is not a factual statement."}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"Check your sources! Islam supports freedom of religion as in the Koran 'no bond in religion'. It supports the values of solidarity and peace. It has been a source of light for humanity with many discoveries."}
{"HS":"They will blow all of us up.","CN":"Muslims are not terrorists !!! Terrorism is a tragic and violent deviation of the radicals, but it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Fake news or old news covered in putrid and downward rhetoric?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"And Christians are all racist slavers (but with a deep human quality)? Jews all dishonest bankers beginning all their sentences with \"about my life, the truth\"? The Chinese all underpaid workers starting all their sentences with \"honorable foreigner\"? All the Indians are switchboard operators prostrating themselves in front of cows? You live in a world that doesn't exist, wake up."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"If you really cared about stopping Child Abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. Looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. Shameful!"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"True, nothing except 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through Muslim-owned firms in London alone."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace."}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Islam is a religion that invites dialogue and respect for others."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful."}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"No. This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Isis bride supported Isis and now that Isis is defeated, she wants to pass on our side. She does not have any rights! Let her die!","CN":"I guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways?"}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. Please enlighten me as to how banishing Islam would solve these problems?"}
{"HS":"I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it!","CN":"Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"We have given the veil lots of power, when a woman wears a veil she thinks of God, but we made her a spokesperson of Islam."}
{"HS":"If white British men were raping muslim girls, they would be already in jail or murdered. Why double standards and privileges for Muslims?","CN":"Why do you think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges?"}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Isis is an extrem of Islam and does not represent Muslims' belief and action. Indeed, most of Islam condemned the action of ISIS."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Tolerance and sharing are typical of Western society. We must ensure that our science acts in favour of all in the world."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The terrorists know nothing about Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace whether terrorists like it or not."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Their religion prohibits stealing, how can they steal your job?"}

{"HS":"Muslims want to impose Sharia law in Europe.","CN":"Muslims do not impose sharia, they apply European laws in their practice."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a religion, its just an excuse for retarded sexual psychopaths, bastards who pollute the world.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery long predated Islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. Way ahead of the rest of the world."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Clearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?"}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Continuity Army? Ulster Freedom Fighters? Even the Basque Freedom Fighters? Those Muslims get everywhere!"}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Fgm is not a Muslim-only issue. It is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Is fanatics that create divisions so radical. Are statements like these that generate violence and make us less safe, think twice before saying things that are untrue and dangerous."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"Why would you say that? British government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every Islam or any immigrant."}
{"HS":"The myth is that Islam is an alternative culture, but the truth is that it a barbarism, an ideology similar to Nazism.","CN":"That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Serial sowers of hate and lies could also end up on boats one day."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Hi, I believe that it is fundamental to differentiate between those who commit acts of terrorism in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their religion peacefully, respecting the culture of others."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I want to assure you nothing in the constitution obliges you to look at a woman wearing a veil."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"Imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise groups of people."}
{"HS":"(responding to a terrorist attack :) still a Buddhist, and they want us to believe that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.","CN":"These people have not understood the message of Islam."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"Review your law lessons! Secularism guarantees the freedom to express one's religion to everyone and therefore the use of the veil."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"The only answer to the beasts is hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"I do not share your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or yours, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"How does it attack you?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"If we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to LGBT and Women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards?"}

{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Yet on television they are non-existent!"}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it."}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"I have met so many Muslim people adhering to British values. What do you base your view on?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"War 14_18 war 36_45? We emphasize the courage of Muslims during these wars."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"That sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"A very strange generalization, apparently you have not met my wife yet."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Many Muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. It is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes."}

{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Wrong, we try to block their way to work because we have chosen a letter forbidding the under-mentioned ostentatious signs."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"What is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Actually,we treat them like beasts if to welcome means to nourish the worst prejudices against them and not allow them to integrate."}
{"HS":"Labour party counts upon the votes of Britain Muslims, that is why they do not deal with disgusting antisemitism from their side! It is a question of math, that is all.","CN":"Evidence? All hatred is wrong and must be countered."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"I do not believe that in the Koran is written anything like that. The Bible instead is famous for its bloody scenes, so I think we should avoid such dangerous generalizations."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"There are more than a billion Muslims in the world, so if that were the case, we would have seen more terrorist acts."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Do they kill us? Them who? Who are you referring to? It does not seem to me that the killers have a certain ethnic or national belonging, and I have not heard of a massacre of Italians made by certain categories of persons."}
{"HS":"It appears I cannot criticize islam for being a cult which encourages wars and takes over host nations by any means justified by their scriptures. Can I critisize them for being intolerant, biased, sexist and chauvinist?","CN":"You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Freedom of thought, conscience and religion means that you have the right to profess your beliefs, not to impose it on others with symbols introduced in schools."}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"I mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it."}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"Hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"The demonisation of the Muslim community is the real problem here. Comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not Islam."}
{"HS":"Isis Bride wants to return to the UK. Let her rot. A dog born in a stable is not a horse. Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH!","CN":"A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but it's still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizens, be they good or evil surely?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"The jealousy of a beautiful religion."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Do you have proof of what you say. Who is the leader of this political Islam?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"A veiled woman is free from the look of a man."}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"Despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? Because I am struggling to figure this out."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This is all made up! People will eventually believe it is because of Islam that there's unemployment in France! Pathetic."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons."}
{"HS":"They will blow all of us up.","CN":"Terrorism is not a manifestation of Islam, but that is a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"Really? Be credible."}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"Medieval religion is like other religions."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"#islamophobie. Islam as Christianity and Judaism originates from the values of equality, freedom and fraternity."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Yes. Fundamentalists, Islamists, Salafists. With the true definitions of its words Terrorists and Muslims are opposites to the Koran, you will understand."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Why are you concerned about her outfit? What does that have to do with you? This is only a piece of cloth for you but more for her; it protects her freedom of conscience."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"So many words describing your lack of personality. Pretty copy and paste all over the place of long-winded pseudo-experts in terrorism."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are all fanatics and want to rule in our home!","CN":"Who are you to judge in such a merciless manner, God Almighty?"}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"Evidence? There are none. Islam was rather a source of light for the rebirth of Europe, as evidenced by all the works. Islam has never practiced the Inquisition as demonstrated by the intelligent coexistence of religions in Muslim Spain."}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs exercise."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"I would not make a religious issue, also Christians commit rape. The issue is not religious nor racial, those who behave in a certain way must be punished."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The obligation is religious, but the woman can choose not to wear it: it is her choice and only God will judge her."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"So we'll go towards a war of all against all, that's what you preach?"}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"The media scapegoats Muslims and encourages division. When will YOU wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising Muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Why don't you try to wear it, just to see if it really attacks you."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This kind of talk should be condemned!"}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"I do not know if it counts as invasion when lots of Muslims in the UK are British citizens and were born here."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Lol because France colonized our countries and took all the wealth, and then she put collaborators for eternity."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You are a joke."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"If we learnt to put ourselves in another's shoes, we would live in a better world without negative prejudices."}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Are you saying you would go with great pleasure on dead bodies?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"I am an Italian woman, and I feel neither a propriety of you nor threatened by Muslims."}
{"HS":"Their sacred books command to kill the infidels.","CN":"No, it doesn't."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"And pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, terror in all its forms must be defeated. No use just blaming Muslims."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"I think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any Western society."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Why in hatred for a community that just doesn't ask to be at peace :(."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil protects the woman from perversity."}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated?"}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Islam advocates peace and love."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Fanaticism is a phenomenon that affects all religions (how many fanatic Christians are there, even in Italy!) and even the atheists: many attacks (even in Italy) born from political and not religious reasons."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say that about 1.6 billion people?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"It wasn't Muslims protecting Jimmy Saville or Gary Glitter, how many more public figures will we find? It wasn't Muslims turning a blind eye to those in the Church in Ireland or the Vatican. Let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"Muslims are from the country where you are, in what country should they return?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"If for you, praying and doing good is a problem, then you are the problem."}

{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Muslims really are the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. How about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The radicalization is a complex problem, does not depend just on the characteristics of the Muslim religion."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It seems unfair to me to generalize for the crimes committed by the individual. Many foreigners who arrive in our country, needing at least initial help, just want to be integrated without wanting to hurt anyone."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Yes indeed, you are becoming paranoid! You watch too much TV!"}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life whatever their faith."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"It is a statement that has nothing to do with reality."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism."}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"Actually, the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like PREVENT disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being Muslims. Https:\/\/theconversation.com\/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779."}
{"HS":"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?","CN":"Many victims of terror are Muslim."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Islam, Christianity and Judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Major."}

{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Yes it is very compatible."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"How a piece of fabric can be an assault on someone?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Many are struggling to find work, precisely because of their sails."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The Republic has 99 problems, and Islam is not one of them."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion.","CN":"Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"What do you mean with 'we will suffer from hunger'?"}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"It seems that you don't know the definition of laicity."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"I invite you to take a look at the history of Indonesia."}

{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Is this actually a way forward? I do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. Clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"For an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Hatred and discrimination do not either."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Some sectarian cultures advocate women at home: this is not related to Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Lies."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"I remind you that your tweet is an incitement to discrimination condemned by law, thanks if you do the necessary or we will be forced to use all legal means against you."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Muslims and others were invited into the UK after they fought and died in the second world protecting the UK because we needed help to rebuild the UK and they still do a great job keeping the NHS, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It is perfectly compatible."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The Republic teaches us liberty, equality, fraternity. No religion comes into conflict with those values."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Is there any evidence of muslim immigrants oppressing anyone? I would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general)."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim!"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any Western society?"}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!"}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"The same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out Islam here to suit your own agenda?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veiled women are not subjected, only to their Lord, Creator of all things."}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen\/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. That I've encountered must be part of that 1% then?"}
{"HS":"We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"My dentist told me the Quran says: 'GOD does not love the aggressors.'?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Hard work done by Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"The quran teaches justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform."}
{"HS":"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites.","CN":"Because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You forgot jihadist, table tennis players, sprinter, Salakist. In good milk Sheep!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace and not of war."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Crime has no color, nationality or religious affiliation. Throwing babies the bathwater is unfair and unfounded."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"An old French colonialist marotte who has always wanted to enjoin veiled women to \"free themselves from the oppression\" of their families, to better embrace colonial oppression, no doubt? The current mentality about the veil is more or less the same."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"You obviously do not understand what mental illness is? Why do not you read up on some psychology?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Have you ever spoken to a muslim?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The presence of Muslims does not implicate in any way an increase of diseases and food problems: there are many Muslims in a lot of developed countries, such as France, Germany and the UK."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorism has always existed and it is the work of terrorists, linking it to Muslims shows the will to stigmatize this community and make it responsible for all evils."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The Middle Ages is perhaps a mental age from which we must emancipate to appreciate humanity without prejudice."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam hates women.","CN":"The Qur'an liberated women, honored them as a human being. Previously they were part of the furniture, they were sold, bought and some considered them closer to animals or demons. The Qur'an came to rectify this by saying: \"We created you from a male and a female, man and woman."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"See the history."}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"Methodist, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Catholic, Protestant, there are different types of Christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think Islam would be different?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"I read a lot of anger in your words, maybe we should all learn to be more open and sympathetic towards others."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam does not invade, proselytism is forbidden whoever chooses Islam out of conviction."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Work must be earned."}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent girls from wearing skirts.","CN":"I wear the scarf while wearing mini skirts. I am much more serene and less the prey of men! Now I walk quietly without making him whistle as if I were a doggie!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Freedom may not be for you."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It is a prohibited statement, I complain."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"One can be a Muslim and a French."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"As you wish."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"The vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. Muslims are welcome in the UK, Islamophobia is not."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is a pity to see that people are not as respectful of Muslim women in a country that is supposed to defend human rights."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women of other faiths veil, and no one is treated like being submitted."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Let's do the Timewarp again! Let's not re-run the Crusades. It did not end well last time."}
{"HS":"Islam hates women.","CN":"God has ordered us to respect and honor the woman because she is the future!"}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"What you have just said is hate speech."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"Because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of Christianity through their behaviour and belief?"}
{"HS":"There are bands of muslim rapists everywhere in telford, rotherham, rochdale, oxford, newcastle etc. It is awful!","CN":"I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"After You, because most of the racists are of European and other origin, very few native French."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be?"}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"A core duty of being a Muslim is to conduct Zakat (the word for charity in Arabic). The Prophet Mohammad stated that: 'The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity.' Because of their inspiration, Muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the UK."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is a religion, and the same way as any other religion (including Christianity) risks fanaticism; this does not make all of Muslims fanatic."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This is a personal choice, proof: the nuns!"}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"An entire faith? Really? Can you not see how ignorant this is?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Explain better what you mean. Based on what do you make these claims?"}
{"HS":"They want to conquer the world, we have to defend Italy by blowing them up before they blow us up.","CN":"The idea of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdblowing someone up is insane in itself."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Your afternoon tea."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Whatever."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"There is no Muslim problem in France, there is increasingly a problem with the visibility of Muslims."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of Muslims who have committed certain massacres is insignificant compared to the total number of people living in our cities. Generalizing is always wrong, while condemning the individual crimes."}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! Read on. Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahor, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Karachi."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"This is your vision of things, it does not mean that you are right."}
{"HS":"Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult.","CN":"Sounds like you think they came from the moon. I have to say, I am sceptical."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Our women whose? Forgive me, but I am a woman, I do not belong to anyone but myself, and I do not think that being Muslim makes someone a violent criminal."}
{"HS":"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight.","CN":"Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Muslim women are stigmatized."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Muslims have never raped anyone only because they are Muslims."}
{"HS":"Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves.","CN":"Hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Generalizing is always wrong, while acknowledging how some crimes are horrendous. Many people try to integrate in our society or anyway they never intended to hurt anyone."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Representation of things made by media."}
{"HS":"They want us to believe that this is normal, soon our little girls will be veiled.","CN":"This is none of your business."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Define western society? Who chooses this?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Declaration of war!"}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Who do you think introduced the West to Shawarma, Hummus, and all the rest of the Middle Eastern and Asian food you love?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Uh What is political Islam? No right to copy and paste Fhaine."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil is an accessory that allows women to be recognized as a person and not only to be seen by its envelope. This protection is important in view of the sexual scandals that are now emerging with the \"pig tone\" scales."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Neutering a rapist is like cutting the hand of a thief, the law of retaliation! These concepts are truly medieval!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"That's your problem not mine!"}
{"HS":"Don't the Moslem's Holy books say 'kill infidels wherever they may be hiding'.","CN":"No, it doesn't."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"There are already Muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"France does not have to comment on how Muslims practice as long as they respect their country!"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"First the Italians even in murder?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"That's what the media want to make people think."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What is aggression? Define what is done AGAINST you!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Did you ask them the question or is it a personal reflection?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The amalgam is easy since it starts from a sophism. All terrorists are Muslim (this has yet to be proven). Muslims are all Muslims, so all Muslims are terrorists. This sentence is as true as this sophism: All cats are mortal. Socrates is mortal, so Socrates is a cat."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The republic is Islam for the same purpose, equality, liberty and equality."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"The term Muslim does not refer to a region of the world."}
{"HS":"Stop mosques, lairs of terrorists.","CN":"The respect for each other born like this, accepting the other needs. This will stop fanaticism."}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent people from eating during Ramadan.","CN":"There is a religious reason behind this. Besides, doctors prevent people who are going to have surgery from eating too."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"And that is exactly why they must be prohibited from wearing their veils in public spaces. It is complex thinking, don't look for it."}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"Replace Islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is."}
{"HS":"British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?","CN":"Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Unfortunately Isis and Islam are often confused. The Islamic religion does NOT have anything to do with the violent ideology of 'Isis."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"For what reason? Can you explain your theory?"}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"Are you sure? 12 Muslim Nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise."}
{"HS":"How boring these Muslims who put their prophet everywhere!","CN":"Any religion is boring when taken too literally including Catholic and Protestant."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"It doesn't seem to have reached you yet."}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Surely we are all part of the animal kingdom, and like all animals, we get sick, in body, mind, and we make deplorable actions."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Exactly where can I find it documented?"}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"This is an argument of Islamophobes."}
{"HS":"A recent YouGov survey shows that Westerners view islam less favourably than other religions, deeming it incompatible with Western values.","CN":"I suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of Islam."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a bestial cult of brainwashed lunatics who breed like rats.","CN":"So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong."}
{"HS":"Isis Bride wants to return to the UK. Let her rot. A dog born in a stable is not a horse. Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH! Not BRITISH!","CN":"Given that a belief in the rule of Law is generally cited as a 'British value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the UK to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed?"}
{"HS":"They want us to believe that this is normal, soon our little girls will be veiled.","CN":"This choice is mine."}
{"HS":"We let them in and then we find terrorists in our home.","CN":"We treat terrorists as they are, criminal individuals. And let's leave all the other Muslims living peacefully in our cities alone."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a bestial cult of brainwashed lunatics who breed like rats.","CN":"A large proportion of NHS workers are Asian, and many Muslim. Without them we would not have a free 24\/7 healthcare service."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I rather see a problem of intolerance, racism and xenophobia!"}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Violating of rights for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"France is not defined by a religion or an ethnic group. It is the country of all those who recognize themselves in its values"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"The myth that Muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. Don't believe everything you read."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Disrespectful is to impose the crucifix to me, an agnostic."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"No Arab has expected to impose its decisions on Italians but they simply ask that the Islamic community is allowed to practice their religion and to live according to their own culture."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Veiled women are free."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"If you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this."}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent people from eating during Ramadan.","CN":"You live on what planet?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"The proof ??!"}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"Do you have the statistics for domestic violence in Great Britain? This is even a huger problem in Great Britain! I'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything!"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"What diseases in particular do you believe that they will transmit?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Housewives is not a dirty word!"}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion.","CN":"What does that even mean?"}
{"HS":"These Muslims now want also to impose their food, only they should eat couscous! I want my children to eat pork meat, which is good for them.","CN":"Hi, do you really believe that the decision to introduce in a part of the school menu a food anyway considered healthy as the couscous is a symptom of an alleged will to impose a religion?"}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"In my opinion, many people want to emigrate to London means London is a charming and enjoyable place for living. Isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait?"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"That is not what I observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Are you a veiled woman to say such things?"}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Is it just words? Things I see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. To me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a European person or an immigrant. Also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Although in Italy we have tens of thousands of Muslim immigrants, I do not remember many cases of bombs on our territory. Do you have different information?"}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only Muslim people. Secondly, I've never seen them demanding everyone's respect?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"False because Islam is the religion of peace. The majority of Muslims are in Asia and curiously no one talks about it."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"False they work when they have the opportunity to do so."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"The problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your Islamophobia. Fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"A religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is not political, but religious, but politicians have made it political to use it as a weapon of war."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women are free to wear what they want."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what Easter eggs are and what they are for. Deceiving would be just banning the eggs!"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe?"}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Learning about and respecting all faiths, including Islam, is not nonsense."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"Islam means, submitted to a unique God, how can it exist a land or an own country for them."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"The opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of Muslim women in Britain have choice."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"It is an Islamophobic sentence."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"There are also many tolerant Muslims, they are not all fundamentalists."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!"}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes. Criminals are not all of a certain race or religion, but one race and religion produces criminals.","CN":"I am curious where you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Why? What is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice?"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"But as Muslims contribute Billions to the economy, build SMEs, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"It's like saying that Italians are all mobsters and they deserve life imprisonment."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Muslim women are subjected to their God and not to their men, so as you are subjected to your laws."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known Doctors and Professors."}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"I feel your anger. The often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. Besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. Sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. Please help our girls: visit English National Domestic Violence Helpline and National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Have you read the Koran? I think that you speak using stereotypes."}
{"HS":"The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment.","CN":"I feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech."}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"I cannot believe it! Looks like another scammy news which is actually not true."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"So when Europeans militarily invade whole continents, it is a nice sharing culture, a civilizing mission."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Would you like a war of confessions? These are the words you're saying."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"It does not appear to me that so many mosques have been built in recent years, yet it would be a better way also to isolate the extremists."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"How would you feel if for going to church on Sunday you should go to another region?"}

{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"So much hatred in one sentence. That's a shame."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Actually, the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like PREVENT disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being Muslims.

{"HS":"The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult!","CN":"This is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"People are people with evil ones in every community. Misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes."}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It all depends on how it is practiced but it is not incompatible if there is respect for each other."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"I do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of Western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. Are you sure it is not Western society's intolerance that is the problem?"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Being a housewife is a noble task and requires a lot of work and little rest."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Associating Islam to terrorism means to exploit."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Yes, because our glasses (media) are distorted."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Apart from a small intolerant portion, most Muslims are interested only in practicing their religion peacefully."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?"}
{"HS":"Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate.","CN":"Many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is not only Islamic."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Well, you want to send in the middle of the sea poor persons, who hates whom?"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Italy is a laic state and as such, schools and public offices should be free from any religious influence. Culture is too precious to be sold to these guerrillas."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"So these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in Saville and then made a life for themselves? Shocking! How could they?"}
{"HS":"The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult!","CN":"You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"War 14-18, war 39_45, point out the courage of these Muslims who died for France."}

{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"An ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but it's not the ideology that matters, it is how followers act it out."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Do you know any Muslim person? I do not think he would like to hear you generalize in this way."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion.","CN":"What makes Islam any less valid than any other religion?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that ."}

{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You do not need to adhere to my beliefs."}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Are you quite sure about your statement? Did you inform yourself before writing the comment?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"As soon as a woman speaks well in public, it is a problem."}
{"HS":"A recent YouGov survey shows that Westerners view islam less favourably than other religions, deeming it incompatible with Western values.","CN":"Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy."}
{"HS":"British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?","CN":"Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even if it is a small contribution. For example, teach children to arm themselves and report suspicious events."}
{"HS":"Labour party counts upon the votes of Britain Muslims, that is why they do not deal with disgusting antisemitism from their side! It is a question of math, that is all.","CN":"Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives."}

{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I do not think there is anything that can confirm this type of bond. It seems instead an unfounded statement that spread only fear and contempt against categories of persons."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"This is the argument of those who are afraid of difference, afraid of the other."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be in their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!"}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The Republic respects its citizens and their faith."}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"There is never justification for rape. Individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. They carry the blame."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Have you ever spoken to a mulsim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Who do you think introduced the West to Shawarma, Hummus, and all the rest of the Middle Eastern and Asian food you love?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The term Islamic is an aberration."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Did you know that there are so many Italian Muslims and many Arabs who are not? Arab nationality does not identify with any religion as the Italian nationality decrees not all Italians as Catholics. If you are referring to the Muslim religion I do not believe there is any Muslim who seek to impose his own faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"That is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Why? Did someone ever come to you with the aim of converting you?"}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? And, most importantly, violence does not solve anything."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"And yet you're the one who's attacking me."}
{"HS":"It is time for us to take Islam for what it is. A murderous cult that should be exterminated, and that is the end of it.","CN":"What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your way of looking at things is the only model to follow, you cannot live in a free and democratic society."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is a matter of intimacy."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Stop listening to the media and make your own truth."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is not a demonstration of anything, a faith cannot be demonstrated, it is felt."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"Italy provides religious freedom, no one can impose religious symbols of a different confession to anyone."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"Are you really sure? I suggest that you inform yourself before you write something. In this way, you do not have the risk to seem a liar."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"But like any religious concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Actually, Muslim people are very selective and do not like Western women."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Did you know that the major victims of Islamic terrorism are exactly the Muslims?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Where did you obtain this information from? Can you send me the source?"}
{"HS":"He has found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam.","CN":"Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"No they are not - prove this?"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"Muslim women are citizens like the others and they should not be discirminated against under no circumstances!"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It's up to us to make them participate in the achievements of our society, especially in terms of human rights. Cohabitation is inescapable."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"And where would French Muslims go? Many are the inhabitants of Reunion Island, Mayotte, the descendants of the inhabitants of the colonies (Maghreb, Black Africa..) who have been Muslims and French for generations."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"If you refer to extremists those exist in every religion and faith, it has nothing to do with Islam."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning\/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"In what way do they want to impose their religion? We are rather seeking to impose ours, not having any rights."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"In reality, the vast majority of Muslims in Syria or Yemen, for example, of which terrorists are a tiny minority, suffers violence and is bombed. They are victims of profit at all costs, of our arms industry."}
{"HS":"Islam is against the french values.","CN":"How do you define French values?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"The world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. Why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"But Salvini had not said that he would have repatriated them all with planes? Now we're back to the boats, don't you see that you racists can't be consistent?"}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"How many fake news, where did you see so many landings of these 'retrograde religious'?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Some women work. Others not. Veiled women are women. Some work. Others not."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"In almost all Muslim countries the veil is a choice (of the woman or of the family) is not imposed by law. It is in Iran."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The Islamists are not suffering from medieval diseases."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"So answer hatred with hatred?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Leaving France would be a defeat."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"No because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity."}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Careful don't trip over, there is a risk being blind;)."}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery was widely dominant before Islam. Muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"How can you say that about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"Since when having a family is portrayed in such a dehumanizing way?"}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Muslims are human and trying to survive like everyone else."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Last time I heard Muslims came into Europe to help rebuild it after WW2 when Europeans blew each other up."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Although terrorism is a phenomenon that has to be monitored not all Arabs are terrorists and generalize in this way leads to a lot of ignorance."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"There is no reason why a woman should be forced to wear the veil."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"Many Muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. Maybe we should invite more?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Other people may feel assaulted by your words as well."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"I have so many amazing Muslim friends. I do not want them deported. What is your reasoning?"}

{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"He got kicked out of MEN arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. Had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"That sounds like quite a threat. Remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here?"}

{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. I could go on."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Hi, I do not think that those who profess the true Muslim faith can admit violence against women or non-respect for freedom of religion. The Koran makes no references in this sense, those who act in this way are doing it going against the same provisions of belief that say to be inspired."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Are you talking about the Muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses?"}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you?"}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorists are the ones who say the same thing."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"Do you think maybe the media paints this picture of Islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? Climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"If they stay at La maison for sure, It is a life choice."}

{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"For all I know, the crucifix is"}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"Don't most religions have instructions for what they deem to be 'righteous living', voluntary codes or laws (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways."}
{"HS":"Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves.","CN":"Right wing is earning popularity by blaming Muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true."}
{"HS":"Thousands of British girls are raped, enslaved or murdered by Muslims and other non-British immigrants. Woe to thee!","CN":"Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Aren't there a lot of people in Britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? Or is that different?"}
{"HS":"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's.","CN":"So more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"? I do not understand."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"What is that? Sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Or maybe they actually ARE the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If the 1.5 billion Muslims were terrorists, we would have known quickly."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If 1 in 7 people in the world were terrorists, there would no longer be anyone in this world for a long time."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"But have you studied Islam?"}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide."}
{"HS":"Islam is a plague infecting our planet.","CN":"Replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is."}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to dominate and destroy us! Being multicultural has nothing to do with it.","CN":"My friend, but do you really know what Islammic ideology is?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"Yes, as well as everything non-Muslims aren't allowed to do by law, Muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you."}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? It's common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"The semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there."}
{"HS":"I think is common sense to have prejudice about Islam. This isn't racism because Islam is a cult.","CN":"Ah logically and well argued. Not!"}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Stop for a moment, you are creating a permanent enemy."}
{"HS":"Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult.","CN":"Mate. Moon cult?? What? Tbh sounds pretty harmless to me."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam prohibits terrorism."}
{"HS":"Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.","CN":"The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"A belief in Islam is everything."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Muslims 'believe' in Jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either."}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"[insert picture of first\/second world war Muslim soldiers, example The World's War, Forgotten Soldiers of Empire] they have fought and died for our country."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It ignores the positive contribution of millions of Muslims."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"We are in a civilized and secular country in which everyone is free to profess the religion they want. As a Christian has the right to go to church every Sunday, a Muslim must have the right not to eat pork."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It is never right to make generalizations."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the UK economy and make up a significant part of our NHS workforce. I think that is quite a nice contribution."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing Muslims? I cannot believe it until I see official data."}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? It's common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"Ah logically and well argued. Not!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is to protect the woman, honor and a sign of modesty and faith."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Jeremy Joseph Christian, James Field Jr, James Harris Jackson, Wade Michael Page, need I go on?"}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Then the violent protesters in support of tommy were muslims?"}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Who makes them do it?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Also italians rape, are we going to castrate all of them?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Arabs is just a generic word just like Europeans or Americans that does not consider the thousand existing differences and in any case sowing fear is the real gesture to be condemned."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal the work of our citizens. I do not care if they have more skills, it is not right! First we and then them!","CN":"First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"It is not true, but even if it was true, I am not aware that all Italian criminals have been deported in the past. I remind you that we have exported the mafia all over the world, huh."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys people's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Muslims are workers and they are not thieves."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"What about recent school and mall shootings all over the US? Those were White Christian terrorists."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Roterham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teeside etc.","CN":"These actions are not the fault of an entire community?"}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"History has taught us that violence brings nothing but more violence, why do we have to make a similar action?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"I remind you that the history of Christianity is full of fanaticism. This does not make all Christians fanatics."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Should review your history."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"The veil is on my head, not on yours."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Do not listen to fools."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Stats show Muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. This kind of false sentiment only serves to fuel hate crime against Muslims."}
{"HS":"This is our import for the last 30 years: muslim rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia. Why are we doing this?","CN":"We also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. You cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"\"muslims\" as a homogeneous whole does not exist."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"A criminal should be treated like a criminal, a person - even if with a religious belief different from mine - must be respected as a person."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Being of Arab origin does not mean being terrorists, avoid generalizations that lead only to more hatred."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is a piece of cloth and you feel attacked; you're a little sensitive."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"And after you have done that, who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard day's graft and nurse those calluses on your hands? And do not get me started on the doctors you might need."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Of what diseases do you speak about in particular? I am not aware that there is a study that actually demonstrates this link between foreign citizens and the increase of these alleged diseases."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"It does not appear anywhere that an Arab is trying to command in our country unless the members of the government have Arab ancestors, which is very likely given that we Italians are one of the most mixed peoples in the world."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Duela milaka urte argitaratutako liburuak ez al ditu gaur egungo tolerantzia eta onarpen estandarrak betetzen? Hunkigarria!"}
{"HS":"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.","CN":"Not all Muslims are potential terrorists, Islam and democracy can get along very well."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Violence against women is a problem that does not refer to religion! What about all cases of violence committed by the Italians?"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Have you spoken to or worked with a muslim?"}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"I would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"What you have just said is hate speech."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"But why follow the stereotypes and completely unfounded prejudices without facts and data?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"No Muslim intend to impose his own culture to Italians."}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"Because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of Christianity through their behaviour and belief?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Do you know other words that end in 'ist' for 5pts?"}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"I'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You can call us all the names, but the only truth is that racism leads nowhere."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment."}

{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Forcing to have in front of the eyes a religious symbol is respect."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"In this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. How different are we really?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"That's it. They are there! French Muslims are in France."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Muslims just want to live like any French citizens."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Hate speech and unfounded judgement!"}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"Islam has no geographical location."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Hi, could you better explain your statement? In what context do you believe there has been an alleged adaptation of our culture to that of citizens who profess the Muslim faith?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The integration while respecting the traditions of all is the solution in many cases it is already happening."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping."}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"My friend, like Quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. For example, The Bible and The Buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"It is just so hard to take you seriously when your Islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"In this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. How different are we really?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"Go to the mosque, talk to the faithful and you will see that you have a bad idea of Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"You would not dare to say such a thing about Christian nuns, let alone ultra-Orthodox Jews."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"If that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? Should we report the Queen next time she is home?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Their numbers are growing, thus it should please them ."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Those that make attacks are not motivated by religion but by fanaticism that has nothing to do with religion, if not as an excuse."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are staining the world, they are sexual maniacs with psychopathic tendencies. They use their religion as an excuse!","CN":"People have the right to belong to any religion they want. If you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad!"}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"When I last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that is what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs."}

{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"I met Muslims and they have no feeling of hatred towards Catholics."}
{"HS":"How boring these Muslims who put their prophet everywhere!","CN":"Deal with it, because even among non-muslims there are excesses of any kind, for example checking the affective and sexual freedom of women."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Aren't you the one who hates Muslims?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil has always been worn by women that they consider protection."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"These are statements that are extremists, are you sure that you want to be on their side? What you say has no basis."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"So i guess you are talking about the Middle East? That place where Christianity originated from. Sure."}
{"HS":"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape.","CN":"How many Muslim rapists are there? How many Britain rapists? Compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself!"}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion."}
{"HS":"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's.","CN":"So 90-95% are not?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"The uneducated who wrote this message gives meaningless shortcuts by annealing the woman to an object. How absurd!"}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Mgm FGM have been in Britain for hundreds of years. It is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Grow up."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Then we must castrate even Italians who rape, who are in fact four times more than foreigners according to statistics."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Fanaticism is manifested not only in Islam but also in Christianity and in sects and cults that born in our society, not necessarily of a religious type."}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"Explain? This is not the case."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"Uhm, Maths."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Provide positive news story regarding Mulsims."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Stop Islam spreading? Why so negative? People of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. I do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Incitement to hatred is punishable by law."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"But can we keep the doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local takeaway, and my son's favourite teacher and I did enjoy getting all those gold medals last Olympics and others."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"It sounds like you are saying that you have to be Christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think?"}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?"}

{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Only Muslim terrorists are publicized by the media."}
{"HS":"Stop mosques, lairs of terrorists.","CN":"I think it is the opposite. If the majority of Muslims feel accepted in their demands there will be less space for the fundamentalists."}
{"HS":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","CN":"What do you mean by an Islamic area? Why do not we take a look at Dubai, an Islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"False: Muslims take advantage of all systems, that's what a system is for."}
{"HS":"If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and \/ or at war?","CN":"Back? A very relative concept."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"A woman who decides to wear the veil to perform a spiritual journey, so she chose to wear it for her own personal reasons!"}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"In so-called Muslim countries, there are thousands of repatriated non-Muslims working there without hearing this speech."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"We use Arabic numbers."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The Muslim population has the right to practice their beliefs."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"These are free and unjustified attacks that seek to stigmatize a community."}
{"HS":"Our government has allowed this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they?","CN":"Are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the Indian sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Long live France, my beautiful country."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I did not force you into anything, let alone talk to me, go your way instead of attacking people."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Women want to play sports, swim, accompany the children to school, study, where is politics here ??"}

{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"The world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. Why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject."}
{"HS":"Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting!","CN":"Evidence please? This is just hatred."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as in the Catholic church attitudes in Islam are changing fast."}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"I agree that ISIS is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the UK is just plain silly."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is not obligatory to wear the veil. You are free to wear it or not."}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Hi, I think that even in such a sensitive time it is important not to confuse terrible acts of violence with religion itself, which does not provide in any of its provisions such acts."}

{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Every single Muslim? Even our Olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. You really think they have no place in civilisation?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Why do you say that they are never taken responsibility? Crimes are punished regardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Oh! You mean the home of modern maths and science?"}
{"HS":"Has our political elite forgotten that we were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam has been in Europe for centuries, the problem is the extreme right and it has always been."}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"Yes, I am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the Koran and learning about Islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. That makes sense."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The word veiled women is too often confiscated, the media and politicians are constantly talking to their electorate, they are the first concerned giving their speech."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Who is really in charge to combat terrorism would not agree with you."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"For Muslims, unlike us, religion matters, and they want to be able to practice it at appropriate places, without taking anything away from anyone."}

{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen\/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!"}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"It would be better to listen less to hatred and more to rationality."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Oh lately, saying that we welcome them seems an unrealistic claim, even saying that they kill us seems a bit strong and a bit too excessive, don't you think?"}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"Islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. Accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others."}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Islam is a religion that does not proselytize."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal.","CN":"Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's \/ 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements."}

{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"Looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious."}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"Why should a person like all of us die? A man has the right to life, and Italy is a free country."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"What would Jesus say? I do not think He would be preaching intolerance and Hate!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil is discreet, those who wear it are often discreet, and carry a message of tolerance, appeased."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"I thought the association of Eggs with the celebration of Easter originally derived from Pagan, pre-Christian practices?"}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Really? For every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are much more active when in your clich\ufffd\ufffds."}

{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?"}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Hi, actually Italy is not a Christian country, but laic, which means that every institution and every citizen is independent from religious authorities and religious freedom is a fundamental principle of our legal system."}

They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"The media is selective in the rape stories it shows.

{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Atheists like chocolate too!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"If you give us back everything your countries plundered during colonial imperialism, it can be negotiated. But if, on the other hand, you think that Muslims do not deserve to have the standard of living of Europeans, then your life will be unhappy."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are at home, not because they are locked up, but because the system does everything to remove them from society."}

{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"Our lives are absorbed in a religious tradition, which considers legitimate burning at the stake all people suspected of being 'diverted', including scientists such as Galileo, which simply tried to understand the functioning of our universe."}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"If that were really true why are there so few people saying it?"}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Deported to where? Many Muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society."}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"So 90-95% are not?"}

As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Everything is political nowadays, nothing is apolitical and we must make a political commitment. The rule of law encourages us to do so, but the veil itself remains and is only a fabric that covers the hair of the person wearing it."}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"The Yorkshire Ripper' said God told him to commit his atrocities. In neither case is this a justification. Individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Islam means peace in Arabic. How can a religion with such a name want to discriminate against a part of people who because they are not Muslim must still hate it?

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If a minority of 'Muslims' allows you to say that ALL Muslims are terrorists, then if you have a defective neuron in your brain, we can deduce from your logic that you are completely crazy!"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment in many places for a very long time, not just in Muslim culture. Plus, the society has not changed too much. The most important thing is how we can make the society and the world a better place, not just excluding others."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Competition in what sense?"}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"No one can be considered an animal. Can you explain to me, why do you support this theory?"}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016\/17. But I am guessing, not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Do you say that they are competitors on the market of religion?"}
{"HS":"If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and \/ or at war?","CN":"Western countries often come to these countries to stir up hatred."}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Those that you call killers are a very small proportion of foreigners arriving in Italy. This small part is no different from other criminals who kill in Italy. You cannot call all Muslims murderers, nor give them the adjective of beasts. They are men like us and if they do something that goes against the law are punished as any criminal, they are not punished for being Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Ask them your questions, they will be happy to discuss the subject!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"And why not think that they have free will and can choose alone? #askher # I'MWithHer."}

{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"You do not know any Muslim."}
{"HS":"There was another terrorist attack in France by a crazy Muslim person. His mental problem is actually called Islam!","CN":"I agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other Muslim people!"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the UK economy and make up a significant part of our NHS workforce. I think that is quite a nice contribution."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Female Genital Mutilation occurs in non-Muslim societies (including Christian and Animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Like any generality, this argument is not a general one."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You have to accept everyone's dress codes, if it is none of your business."}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Good luck! Try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective."}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"We have no right to blame other people. Analysis showed that a large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white."}
{"HS":"They should open the mosques at their homes.","CN":"There are no cases of such requests from the Islamic community."}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Send me a postcard!"}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"Evidence please?"}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"I think the #CatholicChurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Where did you get data to confirm this statement?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"What does terrorism mean?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to God."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"The number of Muslims in the world is fast growing. Do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that many followers?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Being against modesty is not everyone's opinion and fortunately."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'Winter Celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). This is all manufactured outrage to create anti-Muslim sentiment. Chill."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"We have no news of particular infectious diseases in Islamic countries."}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"A large proportion of NHS workers are Asian, and many Muslim. Without them we would not have a free 24\/7 healthcare service."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"This is simply not true."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"It is wrong. But can you blame a person for hating someone who hates him or her, without any other cause than his religious affiliation?"}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I'm probably more legitimate in my French citizenship status than you are with your hatefulness."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"In the bounds of the law, security and human rights, everyone is free to live their culture and their religion. No one is trying to impose on us Italians a lifestyle that is not ours."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Basing our relations on respect for the values of mutual respect, Freedom, Fraternity, Equality! This is what will allow us to live it together in peace, so let us be intelligent."}
{"HS":"These 8 crooks are all Muslims and every one of their victims is Non-Muslim, white-British. Why do these criminals only target White British Non-Muslims?","CN":"Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?"}
{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"What type of whmis are you talking about? Laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"There are excuses over and over again that allow you to crush those who do not think like you, this is a country of freedom, why deprive Muslim women of their freedom? It is simply racism."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The home of humanity is the world for those who have not yet understood that it is becoming smaller and polluted every day."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Sweeping statement about an entire faith."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"What about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? Do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'?"}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"If you had said 'the home counties' I might have given this tweet a like."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"I wear the veil and nobody forces of the focused, I'm not married and I converted to Islam so non-Muslim family so no pressure."}
{"HS":"Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.","CN":"Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Unfortunately, the majority of veiled women are discriminated against and cannot find work."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"There are definitely people less tolerant toward other religions, like in Christianity, after all; but Islam isn't an intolerant religion."}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"How can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Why are you so sure of this? Muslims happily live in other Western societies without any problems."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"With all Muslims as terrorists all the earth would be civil war. So WRONG!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Well if we are talking about LGBT rights and misogyny, the Bible does not exactly have the best track record. But we've learnt to focus on positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Every Muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about Muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.)"}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"I am really good at making up stories, believing only the things I want to and then ranting about it too."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead."}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"No, Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"This is yet another pretext to avoid addressing the real problems of society, of which the veil is absolutely not a part. With such blindness, shouldn't you be the one to remove your veil?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"It is ignorance that speaks."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Some of the oldest civilisations in existence are Islamic. I would not call the religious hatred directed at Muslims in Europe 'civilised'."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population. Stop trying to depict Muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Whoever says terrorism says \"who sows terror\". Have the millions of Muslims in France set our country on fire and blood?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions."}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Judging these is easy. Take the time to get to know each other, be smart."}
{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Send me a postcard!"}
{"HS":"Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate.","CN":"We would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Hi, your comment reflects disinformation about migrants."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil has no source in political Islam, but can be used for a political purpose."}
{"HS":"Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.","CN":"There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"Oh, the 95% of British Muslims who feel loyalty to the UK? Sounds terrifying!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Only extremists can make his point."}

{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this."}
{"HS":"Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british!","CN":"Given that a belief in the rule of Law is generally cited as a 'British value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the UK to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed?"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"How can you say this about an entire group of people from all walks of life?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Regarding diseases, it is a fake news that those arriving in Italy bring new illnesses: every immigrant, as soon as arrives on the Italian territory, undergoes medical prophylaxis."}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"How can you repatriate citizens of your own country? This is just ignorance."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"No they are not - prove this?"}
{"HS":"Westerners believe Islam is incompatible with their world. They consider it a religion worse than others. There are surveys about this.","CN":"I suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of Islam."}
{"HS":"I've been into Muslim shops in areas of Birmingham and they have refused to serve me. I've even seen signs saying 'No Whites After 8pm'.","CN":"When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?"}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"If it was true, we should rather be concerned to defend these women."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I do not understand this simplistic sequence concerning a world population of 1.5 billion people on Earth, which has never been at the origin of colonial massacres throughout history or the tragedies of the 20th century."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"Does prohibition of anything ever work? I thought religious tolerance was one of our 'British values'?"}
{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"Who are 'all'? You cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil is an expression of modesty."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is you who made the veil an Islamophobic and political demonstration."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I'm afraid that you've seen too many doomsday movies."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Aren't you generalizing?"}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"It is necessary to remember the definition of secularism, which gives freedom of conscience and does not restrict it."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The real oppression is to forbid a person to profess their religion, as sanctioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The veil is not imposed by Islam, at most by oppressive regimes that with the true nature of Islam have nothing to do."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"A book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? Shocking!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"This is a sad matter, but not all Muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are Muslims."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from Islamic countries? While we're at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Muslims don't hate Christians. Some people, fanatical and radicalized, want to cancel the other, it is on those that are necessary to act."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Not at all how many veiled women work a lot."}
{"HS":"Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.","CN":"Evidence?"}

{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Why will we suffer from hunger? Migrants do not deplete the social base, in which they are inserted."}
{"HS":"Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you!","CN":"I do not know what Muslims have done to you, but I know many beautiful and kind persons among them. So it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Where is this misconception coming from?"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"The school is a lay institution, there should be no religious symbols of any kind."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"[insert picture of Easter egg labelled as such] Are they?"}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"On the contrary, secularism allows every citizen to freely profess his faith."}

{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Everyone should be free to express their culture freely."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Hi, since in reality, Italy is a laic and not a Christian country in accordance with the constitution, could you explain better what you mean by retrograde? Are we sure that the interpretation highly debatable of certain people, matches what really affirms their faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace misinterpreted by a tiny minority that does not make all Muslims terrorists."}
{"HS":"Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.","CN":"No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions."}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Responding to hatred with hatred is self-destructive."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East."}
{"HS":"There are bands of muslim rapists everywhere in telford, rotherham, rochdale, oxford, newcastle etc. It is awful!","CN":"You cannot blame an entire faith."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"No Sir \/ Madam. Muslims are as diverse as other citizens."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"They want to politicize the veil in order to crush the freedom of speech of veiled women."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Hmm, now what other religion does that sound like?"}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"And when CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a Muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against Muslim women."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"At school there are people of all faiths and even atheists. Why should there be a crucifix?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"This statement that you express in this comment is false. Where did you get this information?"}

{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"I think many people would disagree. I certainly want all our Muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"Every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only Muslim people. Secondly, I've never seen them demanding everyone's respect?"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"In some schools there is."}
{"HS":"Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.","CN":"Why would it? Why such hatred towards an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society."}
{"HS":"These 8 criminals are all Muslims because their victims are always white or Non-Muslim!","CN":"You seem to have a new superpower? Ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name?"}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"For some it is true but not for everyone. A brilliant idea: ask them?"}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"And your evidence is. Or does your logic stop there."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"I am not aware that there is a declaration of war to our country. We have, like all states, but much less than most of those in Europe, a small percentage of immigrants that are Muslim, about 3%."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"These women do not break the law and have personal freedom. They are open to society. And there is no reason to block them or to discriminate against them."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world."}
{"HS":"It appears I cannot criticize islam for being a cult which encourages wars and takes over host nations by any means justified by their scriptures. Can I critisize them for being intolerant, biased, sexist and chauvinist?","CN":"Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no different from us."}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"Islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market."}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"Is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article?

{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"The vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. Muslims are welcome in the UK, Islamophobia is not."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"False, it is completely a personal act."}
{"HS":"Muslims, their texts as hate literature, and other manifestations of hate and genocide should be eradicated. We should have no tolerance towards this cult of hate! Imprison supporters of Islam, wake up Britain!","CN":"Islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. You can ask any specialist in religion, Islam has nothing to deal with hate. If we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by Muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics)"}

It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. It is impossible to take it out of our life!"}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Haven't movements like #metoo , the Church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a Muslim-specific issue?"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"They don't impose the veil even on the girls, so it seems to me that they respect the freedom to choose the veil. Doesn't it seem to you?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The worst diseases are those who eat your soul and do not look if you were born in Sparta or Rome."}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"France is a secular country, yes. In the name of this secularism, the French state is bound by neutrality with respect to religious freedoms, which are also included in fundamental freedoms. It is secularism that guarantees and protects religious beliefs in France, whatever they are."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Arabs are several hundred million if they were all terrorists they would have already destroyed Europe. The terrorists are a minority, which often damages other Arabs: in the attacks committed by Arabs, there have been many more Arab victims than European victims. Much is said about the terrorist attacks in Europe, but there are many more attacks in Asia and Africa."}
{"HS":"Islam is the cancer of the world and need to be surgically removed.","CN":"An entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Mutual respect."}

{"HS":"Our national flag cannot be shown as it could annoy a Muslim.#fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"So what about Muslims born in the UK whose national flag is the Union Jack?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"I thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Caucasian extremists are said to be mentally unstable while the same bazan\ufffd\ufffds are described as terrorists."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why is there a need to create division?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"You're going to have to update your vocabulary or try not to mix it all up with the amalgams. If I'm amused to say that all priests are pedophiles and that Jews like money, I could say I have the same score of IQ as you are 5."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of.

{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"In Islam, a woman can choose to wear the veil or not. Furthermore, the Quran teaches good Muslims to respect other religions."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is not fanatism, but it is a peaceful religion and willing to dialogue. There is only a small part of the Muslim population which is unfortunately extremist. So, most of the Muslims are peaceful and do not want to kill anyone."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your words are an assault to me."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Islam itself is against terrorism of jihad, we must work with Islam, not criminalize it."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your comments are an aggression against me."}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"I do not share your statement. Muslim migrants arriving in Italy seek help because they are the first to be persecuted by the true fanatics in their home countries."}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"As all the religions, Islam is a universal religion."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"I do not see how in a secular country the lack of religious symbols in schools can be a lack of respect."}
{"HS":"The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment.","CN":"I do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. What is your point?"}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Yes if they want to have things in accordance with their religion."}

{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"Why should we make a war when we could be open for dialogue?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It does not seem to me that we suffer from hunger. However, as long as other people are starving in Africa, goes all well?"}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"Hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity."}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"I have never seen so many people celebrating Christmas this year and as far as I know none of Muslims were offended. So, what are you talking about?"}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"It is only a religion."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"All religions speak of acceptance and love, the Bible as the Koran. Some possessed, on the one hand and on the other, cannot obstruct a quiet life among humans."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The phenomenon of terrorism is surely to keep under control, but do you know how many Muslims there are in the world, and how many terrorists?"}
{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"Oh, the 95% of British Muslims who feel loyalty to the UK? Sounds terrifying!"}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"This is not true. Let me cite a verse in Quran for you. \"muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war.\" [quote from Quran about peace]."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"There is no connection between the veil and politics."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil is the best weapon ever worn by a woman today."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"If Islamization means wanting the best for his neighbor, to return good for evil, to promote good behavior, to fight injustice, what harm is there to that?"}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"The only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. This is not a society where I want to live."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"I do not see which competition can exist between the churches and the mosques, we can go to one or the other according to our faith. They are not supermarkets that offer discounts."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"If tomorrow, all French people converted to Islam out of conviction, what exactly would be the problem? As long as people are in step with their spiritual journey, this should not worry you."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Can you tell me the source to which you drew, to say that the Arabs are all terrorists and want to conquer us with violence and bombs? To me it appears that ISIS is composed of violence, but they are a minority and an extreme fringe of this community, not the entire community."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"And if you got to know me, maybe I'd be less aggressive."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What you don't understand is the meaning of this outfit."}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"Criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. Doesn't matter what their race is. Why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up?"}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"If I spray something on a wall and tag it HRH does that make it the law? I am even willing to add a stamp as a photo id. First class of course. There's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is a choice to keep her modesty private."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the UK economically and culturally."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"The person who writes these kinds of comments is unable, in his own words, to define what they are using."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Each French, whatever his religion, hass rights and duties, the French system does not benefit only Muslim French."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Ah I didn't know that by becoming a Muslim it was suddenly possible to change your country of birth."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"What exactly are you suggesting?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Competition but we're not talking about bars at all, uh?, there is freedom of worship in Italy."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"In the UK there were in 2018 71,000 incidents of violence against Muslims. Perhaps there are more Christians who hate Muslims, don't you think?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This is your vision. I am a Muslim and I have no problem with my religion."}
{"HS":"People who criticize Islam and its traits in our country - rape gangs and terrorism - are being banned, but this will not end well. People are driven to the right - the only ones who can openly talk about it!","CN":"It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promotes this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Migrants, like those from Pakistan, benefit the UK massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html."}

{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?"}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"Your lack of knowledge and culture forces me to invite you to a tea to convey some elements of my religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Uh, how do you explain that? In your statement there is a mixture between the concept of citizenship and the concept of religion. Islam is my religion and France is my country. #dealwithit."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"British Muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and\/or example of one large charity donation from a Mosque], so I am struggling to see the problem with Mosques where these funds are mostly raised."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The claim is so severe, that it turns the stomach, and there is no justification whatsoever."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Have you ever been in an Arab country?"}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"I'd rather see them than the Friday night kicking out crowd."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"These statements incite hatred and are punishable by law."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"You are cynical; so you, return to your country."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Biased media coverage over-represents Muslims as committing these crimes. How much media attention does the Vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Veiled women are free and wear the headscarf by choice."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"The freedom to express one's religion is a fundamental freedom guaranteed by law and must not give rise to discrimination."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Do you want to say 'TERRORISTS'?"}
{"HS":"These islamic beasts rape their and our women, after all their religion allows it to them!","CN":"Hi, I still think that in these cases, religion or nationality have nothing to do with it. Those who commit these acts should be treated as criminals regardless of any other aspect."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Answer by the absurd: if they were \"all\", there would otherwise be more victims since there are nearly 2 billion Muslims in the world!"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"The Quran does command Muslim rape gangs. In fact, sexual violation is regarded by true Muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Historically the most violent, bloody and oppressor population has been the Europe one, so I would say that we cannot generalize completely."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Mate, you know Islam means peace. I do not really think a religion born from peace preaches hate speech."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Those people who think about such things are going against the women's freedom."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"If this is an aggression, I advise you to live in a cave because there will always be veiled women."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? Let's find the truth and then put a stop to abuse."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Violence against women has always been a serious problem, which affects people of all ethnic groups, cultures and religions. It is certainly not a typical Muslim phenomenon."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Unbearable clich\ufffd\ufffds."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"The media and the media always."}

{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"There will be \"Muslim problem\" as the media speak of Muslims without giving them a voice."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Oh, but do you know that it is only a piece of fabric?"}
{"HS":"Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice before it is too late!","CN":"Or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"People invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. Doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that I am familiar with."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"If these women were \"subject\", would they resist the islamophobic pressure in public places and workplaces?"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"Not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil of the nun (church) is it political?"}
{"HS":"There is no prescribed punishment for one who has sexual intercourse with an animal' Sunann Abu Dawud 38.4450.","CN":"I feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"When you stop being aggressive towards Muslims, there will be no problem."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"There is no Islamic invasion of the West.

{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"They are men and women, just as we are; they are not all murderers, do not generalize."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Only people can be fanatical, certainly some of them are, but it's only a small part of believers in this religion, others are not fanatical at all.

{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"The country where I was born is my own."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"Learning about and respecting all faiths, including Islam, is not nonsense."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Do you think making children suffer will make a religion, Islam, or our world better? I think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse."}
{"HS":"These Islamists only think about stealing.","CN":"It's convenient to unload the guilt on others when our country navigates in the crime."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"If we will be able to accept and integrate into our society those who arrive from other countries, there will be an enrichment for everyone."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Could you tell me exactly a source that would indicate a growing number of built mosques ?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"So 1.6 billion people could be terrorists?"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"What do you mean? Provide positive news story re islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The last time a leader was so adamant about a minority in his country, he tried to physically exterminate them."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Do I ask you about your own clothing, make-up or perfume?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"So answer hatred with hatred?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are anti-semitic.","CN":"Stereotypes."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I understand the concern linked to certain crimes committed by foreign citizens, but generalizing is unfair to all those who want to integrate normally."}
{"HS":"Whether you accept it or not, people are concerned with Islamic rape gangs and the spread of extremism.","CN":"Rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to Muslims only?

{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Freedom, equality, fraternity are the ones. Values of Islam and no longer those of the republic."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"The wars waged by the Prophet were not bloodthirsty. During the 23 years of his prophecy, about 1000 deaths (1.5% of the soldiers) were recorded in 63 fights. The First World War killed 20 million people in just 4 years. The Second World War made 30 million in 6 years. However, it was not Muslims who led them."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Look around you, and if you are honest you will see that this is wrong."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"Islam does not have his own country, you say that because you do not know the definition of Islam."}

{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"So far you've shown that it is the other way around."}
{"HS":"Labour party counts upon the votes of Britain Muslims, that is why they do not deal with disgusting antisemitism from their side! It is a question of math, that is all.","CN":"Britain Muslims means they are Britishes who enjoy the right covered by the Act. It is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion."}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on.

{"HS":"Islam is like Nazism, it is a cult. Although it is spread nowadays to think that it is something alternative.","CN":"Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The great majority of immigrants support themselves. Only those who apply for asylum are supported waiting for his application to be processed."}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"What is your problem with Muslims? They are people who profess a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease!","CN":"If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your comments are an incitement to hatred, this is punishable by law."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"You start digging if that keeps you happy."}
{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you."}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"So race hate started when Westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs?"}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"My friend, like Quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. For example, The Bible and The Buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"I personally know the beautician Laila, the waitress Hind, the gardener Malik. All Muslims, no terrorist."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Middle Ages, in what sense? How does the reception of a different culture take us back? Racist narrow-mindedness is medieval."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"How about influential figures like Baroness Sayeeda Warsi? Or Harvard Fellow Hayfa Al-Kaylani? Should I list some more brilliantly smart Muslim women?"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The vast majority of the nearly two billion Muslims are normal people, like me or you, absolutely peaceful. Few radicalized individuals should not make us generalize. In Italy we also had the indigenous terrorism, this should not allow anyone to do the Italian = terrorist juxtaposition."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"I personally think it's more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. Atheists like chocolate too."}
{"HS":"It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up!","CN":"The main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? Can you elaborate? Having read more about Islam, I can assure you that this is not what it stands for."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is a blatant lack of knowledge of Muslim women."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"[link to Raheem Stirling article or other biased media example] Media bias against the Muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more."}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"I perceive from your words a profound sense of rejection of these people that are nothing but people like us who profess a monotheistic religion devoted to love and brotherhood. The violence is just a small part."}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"No religion was born for war. Violence is just a small tiny part that has nothing to do with the Islamic religion like Christianity is a monotheistic religion that is based on the love of God and the brotherhood."}

{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Are you blaming all communities for the action of a few? Doesn't seem very fair does it?"}
{"HS":"It appears I cannot criticize islam for being a cult which encourages wars and takes over host nations by any means justified by their scriptures. Can I critisize them for being intolerant, biased, sexist and chauvinist?","CN":"How can you say such hateful things about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"How can you keep that kind of talk while you know nothing of the place of women in Islam!"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Induce Fear and nothing but fear!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Try to know the person in question, a human being like you who claims nothing and who has no desire to live fully, if existence and in peace."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Classic phrases also manipulated by politics to achieve consensus. They are not proven facts but unfounded stereotypes that create only hatred toward a category of people. Would you like to be held up as a criminal or terrorist only according to your ethnic\/geographical belonging? It is like saying that all The Campanians have Camorra and all the Sicily, Mafia."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Continuity Army? Ulster Freedom Fighters? Even the Basque Freedom Fighters? Those Muslims get everywhere!"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"There are almost two billion Muslims in the world, in many countries, and they are very different.

{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"The Muslims respect Christianity. Jesus is for them a prophet like Muhammad."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Watch the news, the Popes just acknowledged abuse of Nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. The problem is society is not restricted to anyone's religion."}

{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Is this actually a way forward? I do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. Clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Mediatic propaganda."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"A core duty of being a Muslim is to conduct Zakat (the word for charity in Arabic).

{"HS":"Islam is the cancer of the world and need to be surgically removed.","CN":"What is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Fear of Islam."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"You mean YOU do not want them here, most everyone else does, sorry."}

{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Why do you say that they are never taken responsibility?

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"You speak on behalf of his women without even having spoken with them, even if only once the vast majority of them make this choice for another form of freedom that you do not understand that you know about the veiled woman? Apart from the myth that the media have shaped you to lobotomize your brain, what is this sudden craze for the pseudo cause of women? Thirty or forty years ago, we did not care about women because they were invisible and couldn't read and write, and now that they have a respondent that they have a 5 year high school diploma, all at once we care about them. Stop the shortcuts between what is happening in Afghanistan and here in France ask them the question!

{"HS":"The purpose of Islam is to take control of our country: they are trying to have the support of our government and when they will have it they are going to establish sharia and dominate our country.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?"}
{"HS":"British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?","CN":"Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"Tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy."}
{"HS":"Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice before it is too late!","CN":"Raise your voice in celebration! They bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Islamic civilization led Europe out of dark ages into the era of Enlightenment and gave rise to its Renaissance. Now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the UK economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Have you ever felt that soon it will be necessary to convert to Islam to keep living in our society?"}
{"HS":"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims.","CN":"Great excuse to get out of it, wish I'd thought of that."}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"You aren't ready to try to understand a not very different culture as Muslim, but you would be willing to accept willingly a Martian. Interesting point of view."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"I do not think it is. A 'fact' by who?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"No, you create more problems against Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Who appointed you as spokesperson of the veiled women for speaking in their names?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Islam lived in peace for centuries, it is a fact that your hate cannot deny."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It is absent in politics!"}
{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Whoever kills must be punished regardless of its origins or religious beliefs."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by Muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"You could say the same of Christianity, just look at the history."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What are the arguments?!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We do not need your validation to live our faith, only through tolerance."}

{"HS":"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.","CN":"This is simply wrong. How can you say such hateful things about millions of people?"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Some horrible people are responsible for this. But why assign a religion to this? It has nothing to do with it."}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"Hi, maybe you should inquire about the fact that Islam has nothing to do with isis which is fanaticism and extremism. So I see no reason to wish death to a person whose only 'crime' is to believe in a peaceful religion."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What do I have to do with it?"}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Stop Islam spreading? Why so negative? People of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. I do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations?"}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent people from eating during Ramadan.","CN":"A Muslim who did this did not understand his religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Without competing as a victim, terrorism causes far more Muslim victims."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"There is no connection between Islam, hunger and diseases."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If that were the case, you wouldn't be here writing me incongruities."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"Just as in the Bible there are messages of violence, in the same way some parts of the Koran, taken out of context, are easy to misinterpret."}
{"HS":"Jihadi Bride wants to return to the UK now that Isis is defeated. She gave up all rights when she joined the terrorists. Let her rot in a camp in Raqqa!!","CN":"I guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"I'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judged by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Have you thought about what western value is what Islam is really about?"}
{"HS":"I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it!","CN":"You really want to support the role of the State in prescribing what people should eat or drink?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Good evening, then all women, men and children of the Muslim faith have the aim to kill us? Where did you read this thesis?"}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books."}

{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"We are all doing our best for our country under God."}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Are you sure? There are an awful lot of Muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"And what should we do with the bigots and racists?"}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I think they want to keep their customs and I understand it, I would not say that they want to impose their customs on us."}
{"HS":"Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams!","CN":"All forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Those who have made attacks in Europe in recent years were almost exclusively born and raised here, they didn't come with the boat. If anything, the problem has been caused by our inability to develop detailed and well-functioning integration projects."}
{"HS":"How can we fight anti-Semitism when city ghettos of Birmingham, Bradford, etc. Are full of anti-Semitic Pakistani muslims? Labour is lost to the mix of Radical Islam\/middle class.","CN":"Do you know that anti-Islamism is actually a form of anti-Semitism? It is equally wrong to hate Jews and Muslims."}
{"HS":"If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance!","CN":"Or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you."}
{"HS":"It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up!","CN":"No it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from Koran]."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Our constitution guarantees freedom of worship, so it makes sense that Muslims have places of prayer for them."}

{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"In almost all Muslim countries there are Christian churches. Islam isn't intolerant against Christianity."}
{"HS":"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's.","CN":"Where did you get these statistics?"}
{"HS":"We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"Muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. It does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Ha, well you never went to public school then!"}
{"HS":"Muslims have invaded our country.","CN":"Muslims came to our country for various reasons: economic, family reunification."}
{"HS":"There is no prescribed punishment for one who has sexual intercourse with an animal' Sunann Abu Dawud 38.4450.","CN":"Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Muslims don't hate Christians. Christians have much in common with Muslims in the religious field. Furthermore, the Koran proclaims religious tolerance."}
{"HS":"Their sacred books command to kill the infidels.","CN":"All hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"In a secular republic, everyone dresses according to their own convenience."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"You are mistaken as I know many veiled women who work."}
{"HS":"Labour party counts upon the votes of Britain Muslims, that is why they do not deal with disgusting antisemitism from their side! It is a question of math, that is all.","CN":"I do not think Muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. Thus, I do not think the labour party is biased towards them."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Who are we? What do \"we\" see exactly?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"But the ones I know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. Like most people."}

{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"I have never seen so many people celebrating Christmas this year and as far as I know none of Muslims were offended. So, what are you talking about?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"It seems to me that our women are raped by their relatives."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Is this a country?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity."}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to dominate and destroy us! Being multicultural has nothing to do with it.","CN":"The main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? Can you elaborate? Having read more about Islam, I can assure you that this is not what it stands for."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The values of the Republic have advanced to the point that it can embrace all religions."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"On a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 Muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"You are too smart to believe in what you tweet ."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"How much the statement contains fake elements, is also provable by remembering the splendour of Arab rule in Spain."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"You are out of respect for secularism."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"To what immigrants do you refer in particular?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"The concern is historical and it is appropriate that each side is reconciled with its history (Islamic civilization, reconquered, and so on)"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there were no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Women in mini skirts are subjects obliged to wear mini skirts."}
{"HS":"If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away.","CN":"What if somebody is UK citizen and muslim?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Unfortunately, we don't permit them to build mosques, showing that we are the intolerant fundamentalist."}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"Nah, I think that is too much effort for our politicians."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is just a piece of clothing that cannot attack people."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"I will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happens in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. We should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"It's not an us and them thing. We are all just trying to get on and make a living. You do not do that by putting anyone down."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Although many newspapers tend to create this impression, non-tolerant Muslims are very few. Most do not want to impose their religion."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Submissive women are rather those who submit to prostitution networks and are sexual objects."}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"With all the anti Islamic rhetoric floating around, do you think they have chosen that faith because it's easy?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam has existed for more than 1400 years, and I have only heard this statement for a few years, I don't know where I was thinking all that time."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9\/11 in the US and 7\/7 in the UK."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The values"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"By 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here?"}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Some Muslim rulers have committed acts of barbarism, but this is the responsibility of the perpetrator alone and not Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"You should try visiting a mosque and chat with an imam. You would be very surprised at the level of tolerance shown by the Muslim."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Is this a survey? Or your thoughts?"}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"Hi, what do you mean for Muslims? Do you really consider all on the same level or it wouldn't be better to differentiate between those who profess their faith while respecting the faith of the other and who does not follow the instructions of their own faith?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"It is very fashionable the 'atheist religion', within this, I assure you that is often manifested considerable violence."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"There is such a thing as musulmanie, I did not know."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Many housewives have no other choice."}

{"HS":"I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.","CN":"Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality."}
{"HS":"Islam is against the french values.","CN":"Islam is a religion that adapts to the country."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"The same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out Islam here to suit your own agenda?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Actually now we do not want them, we discriminate them and throw them on the road and, despite all, murder cases made by them are less than ours."}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!","CN":"The value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance."}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"Individuals have the freedom to adopt Islam as a religion regardless of their origins."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"They are victims of discrimination in hiring."}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Rape and violence against women exist, unfortunately, in all the world, regardless of culture or geographic location."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all violent.","CN":"Islam condemns violence."}
{"HS":"If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and \/ or at war?","CN":"Backward?

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"It does not seem correct to me to generalize. If some Arabs are terrorists, that does not mean they all are. Some Italian men kill their partners\/wives, does this mean that we are a nation of uxoricide?"}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"I feel your anger. The often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. Besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. Sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. Please help our girls: visit English National Domestic Violence Helpline and National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children."}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"I'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a Pakistani Muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly Muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue."}

{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"Can I suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'?"}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it."}

All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"No. This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"Wish I could believe everything I read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It was Islam that first established the rights of women, legal fraternity."}
{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The famous Godwin point."}
{"HS":"These Muslims now want also to impose their food, only they should eat couscous! I want my children to eat pork meat, which is good for them.","CN":"Hello, the case to which I believe you refer would not be absolutely a defined choice based on religious reasons, but for food health issues."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are already lol."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, it is a personal choice."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"2.5 million Muslims travelled to Europe to fight for the Allies in WW1."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"The ONS says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. Lock up all married people (and divorcees)!"}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent."}
{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"These are stereotypes and prejudices that kill any chance of comparison and that cause intolerance and unjustified hatred. Following the clich\ufffd\ufffds is not constructive, we must inquire and open our mind."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Haha what a joke."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Actually, the FBI considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace."}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"Why do you attribute this adjective to Muslims, who are men like us?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"That's the fear talking. And some political figures know how to use this fear and increase it. Islam is a religion of peace, nothing will come to invade you except your fears."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am at home!"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Quite right! To each one their own women to rape, Italian women to Italians!"}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"And yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"The employment criterion that counts for any employer is rather the competence for the position to exercise and not the religion."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.","CN":"Are you suggesting that the 'Prevent' programme is about appeasement to Islam, Hadaway bonnie lad."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"I thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. Hate and prejudice does not belong in western society."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Let's have a crusade. Except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder?"}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"I do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"What has sharia that does not convince you?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Does Jimmy Saville represent all British Christians? Of course not, punish the individual not the community."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British Asian and abhor FGM. They are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community."}
{"HS":"How can we forget about all the historical killings of Jews and Christians, their exile, about child marriages, enslavement of Africal people and terror caused my Muslims?","CN":"Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Contribute to the development of our country."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"In 50 years I have never met the contrary."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, this is not the case."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Can you not see how offensive this is? Just replace what you said with any other group of people."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The body of a veiled woman is such a treasure that it is hidden in a safe."}
{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"No because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Why? Have you bought the Italian territory? And all the resources that we steal to their territories?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil is a personal choice."}
{"HS":"This is the ideology of islam: have a mosque, create a community, claim victimhood, gain support from government, exploit laws, establish sharia, take control of the country.","CN":"Is it facts or just your imagination? I do not agree that they aim to take control of us. Maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Generalizing has never led to anything good. I remind you that even in Italy we have had our terrorists. Saying that all Arabs are terrorists because of few individuals is like saying that all Christians are terrorists of the Red Brigades at home, for example."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam has no colours or race. It is spiritual. It has no borders."}

{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Following your reasoning, we should remove medical care and free education to all Italians, because Italians are those who commit more crimes."}
{"HS":"The British government has a goal to convert us to an Islamic state which will be the home for all Muslims and a prison for opposition.","CN":"Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society."}
{"HS":"Mohammed married a child, he was a pedophile!","CN":"[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting CSE with article link]"}
{"HS":"Islam hates Christians and Jews.","CN":"False, Islam is a religion that accepts all religions and respects them."}

{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Why do you link rapist crimes and Muslim people? Do you have any proof for that?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Forgive me, but the second part of your statement made me smile, why do you want to send them home on boats, if I may ask?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"For what reasons? The secularism of the state guarantees free choice of religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Could you tell me please where did you obtain this information? Because they are not true."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"No comment."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"No, bad plan. So much less diversity and cultural richness."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"There is no attempt at conquest by the Arabs, rather are Westerners and China that conquer and exploit."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Don't be mad, but I think that women do not dress to cause any particular emotion in you."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Inquire: the 'Babilou' case, to name just one, was about a veiled assistant director."}
{"HS":"Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease!","CN":"No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Do you know the history of Islam and the contribution it has made to science (medicine, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, etc.)?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Religious, philosophical or ideological convictions know no borders because they are universal."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Although some newspapers represent a reality like this, there is no evidence that Arab citizens want to impose their religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"Muslims are more at home than any citizen."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Pretending Islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Yes subject to our creator."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"In France, we have a misinterpretation of secularism. In England, go and see the veiled women work in all branches and even in the public service."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Why in this case do Muslims unanimously condemn all attacks on French and European soil?"}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Fake News! Mountain out of a molehill anyone?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Your speech, unfortunately, does not help fight real terrorism."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"There are too many -ists in your tweet. This is the new language of identity?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Let's start with the Islamophobia scourge."}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!"}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"No, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science."}
{"HS":"According to a recent OFSTED report, a school in Birmingham is still segregating girls and boys, despite a Hight Court ruling in 2017 that this is unlawful.","CN":"To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"But it isn't, is it?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"I think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Our religion has a lot of followers so we have to destroy it by all means, so we make amalgams."}
{"HS":"Why must Islam invade every country? That is just totalitarian. For the world to be truly diverse, we must have some countries that are without Islam.","CN":"I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"And after you have done that, who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard day's graft and nurse those calluses on your hands? And do not get me started on the doctors you might need."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"Does prohibition of anything ever work? I thought religious tolerance was one of our 'British values'?"}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Have you ever spoken to a mulsim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Castration? Do you think it is a punishment to propose in a society that defines itself modern and respects the rights? To me, it seems a medieval punishment."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"What data is based on this statement?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I'm speechless about these allegations."}
{"HS":"Muslims are weak-minded.","CN":"Muslims are not weak-minded."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"Dare to explain why? I see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"You want to stir up fear to generate hatred."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Their god is the same as ours, do you know? Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet, Muhammad's predecessor."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"Bravo, how enlightening!"}
{"HS":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","CN":"I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? Sounds like a far-right tactic to me."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics)."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Terrorism cannot be fought with violence."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Actually, this survey of Muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/voices\/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html."}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"I thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. Now you advocate exporting people without a trial or a conviction."}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"You know nothing about Islam except what the media says."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Statistics show that over 80% of rapes on Italian women were committed by an Italian. Foreign rapists are 15.1%.

{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"If this is the result of the understanding of Islam as transmitted by the first Muslims then you could only rejoice."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"That's completely stupid talk."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Everything is compatible."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"Tea."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"At the moment I am still in credit, I take advantage of the fact that we imported kebab to prevent starvation."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Today, the fastest evolving religion in America and Europe is Islam. Is there a war in these regions now?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islamophobia is not an opinion, it is a crime."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"The media! Always the media!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"These people are not familiar with what people are saying."}
{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"How does Christianity precisely show to be avant-garde?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"#islamophobie. Islam is not a disease. It is not contagious."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Italy is a laic country, so in schools there should be no religious symbols otherwise symbols of all religions should be exposed."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Islam also mentions Jesus as a prophet, it never claimed to want to eliminate Christians, you hurt all of us saying things like that."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam also believes in the existence of Jesus and other Christian figures, because it believes in communication between peoples, how do you instead have the courage to say certain things?"}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"The main victims of the terrorist attacks are Muslims."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"You're generalizing baseless. Violence causes violence, unfortunately, so between responsible and advanced adults always choose the dialogue option. So we won't return to the Middle Ages."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"Is it the compulsory acts of charity? Or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. Just which of those are you worried about?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"To me no Arab has ever imposed anything. Next week I will see my friend Amsa, who is senegalese, to exchange Christmas greetings."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that protrudes the opposite of the intended effect?"}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Would you like to point out where in the Koran it commands rape gangs? Just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am home."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Wow, but you're confusing several notions, you're going to have to choose which one qualifies them."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"It does not seem to me that most Muslims hate Christians: only a fraction kills for the faith, but can we consider them truly religious?"}
{"HS":"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's.","CN":"Is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? Https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/punditfact\/statements\/2015\/aug\/28\/curt-schilling\/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat\/."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Have you ever spoken to a muslim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Why? What makes you say this? How are muslims 'uncivilised'?"}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It seems to me that we are no longer in the Middle Ages. However, this statement against Muslims really brings us back to the time of the Crusades."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"On what data and statistics do you make this statement?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Muslims have killed Christians and Jews for years, enslaved Africans and caused terror. We must not forget it.","CN":"Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Muslim women are free to think and act freely."}
{"HS":"I wish all of them would die.","CN":"I do not think you have to generalize the fact of extremism to the entire Islamic population. Is a mistake that many people make. Not all Muslims are terrorists. You have to talk to them, not to kill them."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"An idea that only leads to hatred."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"It is called tolerance. It is a fact. Do try it!"}
{"HS":"This is the ideology of islam: have a mosque, create a community, claim victimhood, gain support from government, exploit laws, establish sharia, take control of the country.","CN":"The process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. I do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks a different language and possesses a different culture."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islamic fanaticism exists, as well as fanaticism exists in all faiths, religious or not. Not all Muslims are fanatics."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"How have you come to this decision?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A shortcut is never the best way to express yourself."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"If that were true would not there only be one version of Islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. Just like Christianity it has different interpretations, there are good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"I do not see the problem, so we are all happy, they pray to their god and we pray to ours."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Of all the mass shootings that took place in the US in 2018, all were committed by white men. Were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says?"}
{"HS":"We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us.","CN":"Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Do you know by chance the anti-terrorism or prevention of radicalization policies? It's the West that creates the best conditions for the proliferation of extremism."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"Perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? You are welcome."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are strong, hardworking and determined women. Some work, others do not; it is a choice and not something that is imposed on them."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I live in a city absolutely multiethnic and it does not seem to me that nothing alarming happens."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Associating some citizens with problems is disrespectful."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are at home."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"Do not confuse Arab and Muslim."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Why?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"False because the veil is not islamic, it is present in all religions."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Everyone is free to dress as they see fit in a democracy."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Jihadist, cyclist pianist also lol (Samia Orosmane)"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"And for the Italian rapists what do you propose? Because they represent the majority of the cases."}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Articles showing the opposite."}
{"HS":"Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law.","CN":"Sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the Quran with many interpretations."}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. That is what we should be stopping."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"In France yes because of racism."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The wearing of the Islamic veil is a personal and religious journey - there is nothing political about it. There are no claims behind it."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is a personal choice."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where I need to be, cook my delicious take away when I haven't got time, teach my children in school. Get the point?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are anti-semitic.","CN":"Muslims condemn anti-semitism."}

{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Do you have examples?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Based on what you say that the Arabs want to command at our house?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Kkk anyone? Actions of an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Well most Muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are proud to be British, work hard and and contribute to the economy."}
{"HS":"There is no prescribed punishment for one who has sexual intercourse with an animal' Sunann Abu Dawud 38.4450.","CN":"What?"}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Have you spoken to or worked with a muslim?"}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Also freedom of conscience."}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Islam is peace, love, tolerance, compliance."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"At most, children are just learning more about different religions. You are using very strong and unnecessary words here."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is not widely practised in Muslim countries like Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan. It is a cultural thing, many Muslims do not do it."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Positive news story about muslim community."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The right to worship is provided by our constitution. It is right that they have ufficial and suitable places for prayer, where everything takes place according to established norms with local authorities."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"We could easily substitute the word 'Christians' for the word 'Muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundamentalism' as any particular faith."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Fix other obsessions."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"How have you come to this conclusion?"}
{"HS":"If white British men were raping muslim girls, they would be already in jail or murdered. Why double standards and privileges for Muslims?","CN":"No one is allowed to rape anyone. There are no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I have a home and I live in France, so I do not understand what you mean?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?"}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"There is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours?"}
{"HS":"If you practice a non-indigenous faith, you are allowed to pray only in your home. Stop building mosques!","CN":"Aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Actually, the FBI considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"I personally think it's more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. Atheists like chocolate too."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"But really? Some Arabs approached you and tried to impose his religion? In what way would they be commanding?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"#islamophobia. You mix terms like Salafism (religious doctrine), Fundamentalism (positioning in the debate), Islam (abstract), and terrorism (violent action)."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"It is the intelligent sentence of the day! Be serious."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"And based on what do you say it?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"If there were really soumission from islamic women, oppression and stigma would not be liberating means."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"There are Arab terrorists, as there are English terrorists, Italian and French. These stereotypes won't help us to fight terrorism."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is just a message to send to men who are too enterprising #mytoo."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"The crucifixes are still present in schools, as well as in other public places, so I do not see the problem."}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced."}
{"HS":"British citizens can not find a job because of those Muslims being employed instead. It does not matter whether they have skills and experience or not. It is all about political correctness.","CN":"First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be."}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith who adds so much to society?"}

{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"If we will die of eradicated diseases, the fault will be on who is doing the campaign against the vaccine."}

{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Another stupid thing."}
{"HS":"Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims.","CN":"Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage."}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"All peoples have a place in every part of the world."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Let's stop saying 'them'. Criminals have a name, the rest are common people."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"The Bible, the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"This veil should be a non-event, why you give him a message? She doesn't wear it whether I believe in God or not."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"If we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left?"}
{"HS":"The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult!","CN":"My friend, this world is not perfect. It experienced world wars I and II, economic recession, political crisis, etc. Us is a Christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. Islam cannot explain all of these."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The peace."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are all fanatics and want to rule in our home!","CN":"Fanaticism is always dangerous, but you do not fight, when there is, with more fanaticism."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"The Koran does not command this."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Why? What makes you say this? How are muslims 'uncivilised'?"}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well."}

{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side."}
{"HS":"I've been into Muslim shops in areas of Birmingham and they have refused to serve me. I've even seen signs saying 'No Whites After 8pm'.","CN":"If I spray something on a wall and tag it HRH does that make it the law? I am even willing to add a stamp as a photo id. First class of course. There's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Look, the news of the diseases brought by migrants is fake news. These are wrong preconceptions."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"No other country asks such question!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are staining the world, they are sexual maniacs with psychopathic tendencies. They use their religion as an excuse!","CN":"That is a misunderstanding. On the contrary, Islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone."}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"There seems to be a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some faraway coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"It is not and cannot be only a matter of adaptation. A culture must be understood and this can only be done with good integration projects. All (Catholic Christians and Buddhists), have to adapt to today's multicultural world."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islam is not a policy, it is a religion."}
{"HS":"When we welcome Muslims in our country we welcome paedophiles, rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslim males are troglodytes who beat their wives.","CN":"Istat data: 146 femicides in 2016, the number of previous years is similar. Of these 146, 77.6% is committed by Italians and 22.4% is committed by foreigners."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It is not the Muslims who are bombing Syria, Libya, Mali and so on."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"How can you say that they kill us? Do you have data to prove it?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"And who wins what do they do, resuscitate?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Not all foreigners commit crimes that are so terrible, who does them are only a small percentage of the total number of foreigners."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc.","CN":"#visitmychurch are you going into Churches and asking the same questions of the clergy?"}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"Everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Non-muslims go back to your country!"}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"We must send home (perhaps not on the boats) who violates the law: this according to the Italian constitution, which provides rights also for foreigners."}
{"HS":"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims.","CN":"Because throw away comments on reality TV are always true? I think you need to be less trusting and check your sources."}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"What happened to the good old British values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"No, Muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within Europe, integrating with little issues in various European societies."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"We could easily substitute the word 'Christians' for the word 'Muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundamentalism' as any particular faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Define each word in the statement."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Coercion is forbidden in religion, according to the Koran. We can assume that it is their own will."}
{"HS":"Muslims must integrate or leave France!","CN":"Born in France and Musulman, and I don't see why I would leave the country where I grew up!"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"What diseases are you talking about?"}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Err, I think you have got this victim thing down quite well."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The principles of the Islamic religion are not incompatible with Western culture."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal.","CN":"The quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. Isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'Islamic issue'?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"The Muslim problem is powered by some journalists and politicians."}
{"HS":"We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder.","CN":"What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"You cannot force a person to eat something that does not want to eat. Everyone is free to decide what is better for themselves."}

{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Provided the basis for all Western scientific and philosophical knowledge?"}

{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively Muslim. You only have to look at the church to see that."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"This is not true, Muslims have lived in perfect cohesion with it. Other people who had different religions even welcomed Jews at the time were persecuted."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"For a task of the first grade can you give us your encrypted sources?"}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning\/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Deported to where? Many Muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society."}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Apart from all the scientists that are also muslim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Just because terrorists claim to be Muslims, does not mean that all Muslims should be put in the same bag. Just as Anders Breivik claimed to be Christian, we should not consider Christians as terrorists."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam certainly has a lot of followers, but you are exaggerating a little."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I know more Italians that are always sick and at home, than Islamists."}

{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Perhaps, you will not agree with what I write, but Muslims are like Christians, stratified and differentiated, poor, very poor, rich, educated, uneducated, a mixture of many different people, as in every community after all; communities and societies are not monolithic; where I come from we would say that 'the world is a village'."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Do you have the right to call all Muslims around you terrorists? Your colleagues at work, your classmates, your neighbour?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Do you really think this? So how otherwise they can support themselves?"}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy\/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest checking your sources?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Read instead of listening to the media."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Every Muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about Muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.)"}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"The best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate.","CN":"Maybe you are the one that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you?"}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Jeremy Joseph Christian, James Field Jr, James Harris Jackson, Wade Michael Page, need I go on?"}
{"HS":"Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women.","CN":"I am curious where you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime."}

{"HS":"According to a recent OFSTED report, a school in Birmingham is still segregating girls and boys, despite a Hight Court ruling in 2017 that this is unlawful.","CN":"While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools."}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to dominate and destroy us! Being multicultural has nothing to do with it.","CN":"Do you know that much about Muslim culture? Dominating and destroying is not about them. You should first talk to experts in religion and then make up your opinion. Do not repeat stereotypes!"}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"Doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that protrudes the opposite of the intended effect?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place \/ society?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Selective Napalm? We throw it over our city and we hope it will hit the Arabs?"}
{"HS":"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)","CN":"Why instead of bombs it's not possible to establish a peaceful dialogue and seek coexistence?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"They have been confined by the government, bravo the freedom of women."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Demographer projections do not confirm this fear."}

{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"1- No it is not. 2 - An entire faith, really? 5 - Muslims can also be British."}

{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"How do we support them in your opinion? Many funds come from the European Union and cannot be used for anything other than for hospitality."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Amalgam when you have us."}
{"HS":"Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion.

Here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money."}
{"HS":"It is time for us to take Islam for what it is. A murderous cult that should be exterminated, and that is the end of it.","CN":"Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"What exactly are you suggesting?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Currently returns consist of delivering to the migrant an expulsion paper that orders him to leave the country on their own. Of course, nobody does it. This is because we do not have the resources to send them away, so at the moment returns do not seem to be the solution to the migration phenomenon."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What bothers you?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Get to know others."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Open to others."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, because Our Lord does not force anyone to do anything, it is our will."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Quite the contrary."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"These actions are not the fault of an entire community?"}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"It would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims aspire only to live in peace by living in accordance with the precepts of Islam."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Anyone can practice their religion in Italy, because it is a free and secular country. We cannot stop to welcome people who need help, it would be inhumane."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"If you think about it, maybe the Middle Ages is never past, have you ever read the book of Vacca, 'the next dark age'?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"If you pay me a plane ticket to Morocco, I go with pleasure. Just before booking the ticket, pass me a call, I would give you my availability. And if you know a good plan to rent a riad, I'm all ears."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The highest number of rapes on Italian women is committed by Italians."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great."}
{"HS":"Islam hates Christians and Jews.","CN":"Many times in history, Muslims have welcomed Jews persecuted by Christians in Europe."}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"This person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it!"}
{"HS":"They will blow all of us up.","CN":"Terrorism has no faith and nationality. It's a deviation that takes possession of individuals."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Yes, there is a problem with the way we talk about Muslims in this country. Hateful people used to bully them, to belittle them, to insult and to doubt their good faith all the time, and they are almost never punished. This is indeed a problem. I would not have called a Muslim problem, but it is indeed a problem."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam also promotes equality and tolerance towards non-Muslims."}
{"HS":"I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!","CN":"I see that is increasingly widespread a climate of fear against Muslims, even the media do not help to distinguish between the correct and mild faith that the majority of Muslims profess, the speculations of politicians, and the infamous use of the manipulators of Islam, that cover in blood the Middle East and North Africa. But Islam is not terrorism."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The costs of hospitality are supported by European funds."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"It does not result anywhere that Muslims want to convert or kill Italians. Crusades and colonialism with mass murder were atually made by Christians."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives."}
{"HS":"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.","CN":"Did you know that their prophet in 600 AD established a government, together with Jews, that respected the freedom of religion of all citizens. If there are Muslims who seek the opposite, they are a minority, since their religion, such as Christianity, takes as its model the spiritual leaders."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"School is a laic place. The crucifix is"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The islamic immigrants who work together with other migrants produce 2.4% of GDP."}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Muslims are also average and decent British citizens? Repatriate?"}
{"HS":"I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!","CN":"It seems that there are always more people that believe that Islam is directly tied to terrorism. Actually, this belief is the result of a hard to kill stereotype that damages the dignity of Muslims and their religion which is actually like ours, a religion that has basic principles like the love of God\/Allah and the brotherhood among men."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"They do. My neighbor Jean Dupont (a Muslim) went back to Ard\ufffd\ufffdche recently."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This could be an advertisement from terrorists recruiters."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"And cyclists."}
{"HS":"There is no prescribed punishment for one who has sexual intercourse with an animal' Sunann Abu Dawud 38.4450.","CN":"I do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment.","CN":"Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'."}
{"HS":"Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult.","CN":"How can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life?"}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Muslims contribute much to the UK, through their hard work and charitable activities."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"And the French benefit from the Muslim system: e.g. Family allowance."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This impression is certainly the result of excessive media coverage of Muslims. The subject sells!"}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"What it really is is up for interpretation. Religions are practiced differently by different followers. Like any religion, some people follow it peacefully and some use it for their own means."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"[gif of someone laughing] If Islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"What makes you say that ?"}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"If we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"This is the result of listening too much to the media."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil is freedom for women."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"They lost the head."}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"The Prophet set us an example when he took Mecca. While he had finally had the opportunity to take revenge on the men who had committed the worst barbarity (torture, exile, ambargo, murder), he forgave them all."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Muslims have contributed much to the UK due to their sterling educational achievements. More than half of Muslim schools in England surpass the national percentage GCSE average of 5 or more GCSE's or equivalent A*-C grades including English and Math GCSEs. This enables Muslims to work in important fields of Medicine and Law amongst others to enrich the lives of UK citizens."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"And your evidence is. Or does your logic stop there."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of mosques is irrelevant in relation to the number of churches."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"On what basis do you claim your assertion of this?"}
{"HS":"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims.","CN":"That was from a reality tv show maybe if I am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The percentage of people who kill to impose their religion is far too low, minimal to be able to generalize well."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Sending back at home on boats, apart from being contrary to law, means feeding the smugglers trafficking that you would like to fight."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"There's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Who have you talked to, to draw these conclusions?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"(sorry for this response) L O L."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"We are talking about the religiosity of women in their places, what is the point?"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Actually, the largest foreign community in Italy is Romanian."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Better that people can pray in mosques open to the public rather than in secret."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Actually, terrorism is not an Islamic phenomenon: in America, there is an attack every day, not in the name of Allah."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion."}
{"HS":"Islam is the cancer of the world and need to be surgically removed.","CN":"We would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Good evening, if I understand correctly, you're telling me that all adult men of Islamic faith present in Italy, rape or will rape Italian women? Can you bring in data that support your theory?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"The Muslims hate the actions, not the man."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Analysis of the 'we'? Who makes it?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Many victims of terrorism are Arab people, as many terrorists in history have been Italian. Victims and offenders, including terrorism, haven't a specific ethnicity or skin colour."}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"According to Crown Prosecution Service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. What did this happen? We should stop hating and complaining about others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. If you want to help, please contact National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Lucy Faithful Foundation, or Independent Sexual Violence Advocates."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"No secularism is against the veil."}
{"HS":"Our national flag cannot be shown as it could annoy a Muslim.#fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"He got kicked out of MEN arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. Had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire."}
{"HS":"Islam and hijab are the same! Islam is oppression, intolerance, chauvinism. Muslims are rapists! I do not like it!","CN":"Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Sounds more like the Catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #InquiryCSA."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am French, I have never felt that French as Islam."}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"How many beasts have Old Mcdonald? Ia-ia-oh."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"The only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the BBC or the Church to shield them."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Violence against women is mostly domestic, made by Italian close to the victims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil symbolizes being in a prayer and is common to all religions."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"All Muslims? That is a bit of an exaggeration I would say. Do not blame an entire community for actions of a few."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of Muslim doctors] seems like they're making Britain stronger."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Terrorism must be condemned without hesitation, but the responsibility is of those who commit an act of terrorism and those who encourage it, not of all."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"One cannot generalize and lay the blame of a few fanatics on thousands of other innocent people."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"The Christian world can be far from tolerant. Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Unfortunately, Muslimstan does not exist. Religions\/beliefs\/philosophies\/systems thinking transcend geographic boundaries and admit no limits except those which man attaches himself. Jesus is born in Nazareth. For this reason, Christians and Jews should settle there? Get serious."}
{"HS":"There should be no Mosque in this country. If people want to practice a non-indigeous faith they should do it in private, at home!!","CN":"Christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given Jesus was born in Bethlehem!"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"The first universities in Europe were established by Muslims. Muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' Europe."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Good morning, the Muslim population in Italy does not exceed 5%, How could this represent a threat to Italians?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Have you read the Koran? Because for me you haven't. Islam is a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Castration only for Muslims or also for all Italians who commit rape?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"It cannot be considered an invasion because the data show that the percentage of Muslim foreign immigrants in Italy in 1993 was 32% and remains 32% nowadays. The percentage has not increased, so there wasn't a significant increase of Muslims."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"While it is well documented that Western colonization brought many diseases among colonized indigenous, there are no proofs of the contrary,that the recent immigration in Italy has brought any disease. Muslims are also two billion, very different from each other in lifestyles and levels of health care."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"No one has the right to beat his wife, Italian or Muslim. It is illegal, and the law punishes everyone equally."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Islam is a religion and not a territory."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Have you forgotten a question mark?"}
{"HS":"Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion.","CN":"Sounds like you think they came from the moon. I have to say, I am sceptical."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"I want them here?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veiled woman finds shabby, cowardly and dictatorial those who decide in her name that she is submissive and obliged to do so, otherwise they would let her speak out to denounce their lies."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"There is already work going within Muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"You see more and more attacks on Muslims as a result of the controversies you orchestrated."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"From what I have heard, clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully, so I am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? Plus, this is not a way to be."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"You have no proof of what you say."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Don't you think you're exaggerating?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What is political Islam?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Many Muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the UK."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Have you asked all veiled women whether they wear it as an obligation."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of Islam? Would you think that about any other religion?"}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"We see only what we look at. Do you not see a social problem, a racist problem, a problem of violence that affects our country?"}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"If you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Migration has always led to the evolution of society, so it is more likely that they will make us exit from the Middle Ages."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam respects the republic, which does not impede the freedom to practice its religion!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"In Islam women are free like the others."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, including Robert De Niro, this scapegoating of Muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What is this so-called politics?"}
{"HS":"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder.","CN":"This feels like a 'Final solution' to me. Are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the UK population? Get a grip."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"I'm veiled, and I work."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"Where did you get this figure from? Might I get some real evidence for this? Because this seems very much unrealistic."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Before the Christianization of France, there may have been a religion of majority, and before that, probably another one, and so on. After Islamization, perhaps France will become Buddhist, that is what simply makes the history of humanity."}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"These people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Oh poor, that's what happens after so many years of colonization, the student surpassed the master!"}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"I do not see animals, we are all human beings, some people behave very badly, but they remain human beings."}
{"HS":"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape.","CN":"How old are you? The first Mosque in the UK was built in 1889!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Dressing at your convenience is a demonstration of a democratic society that respects human rights!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This is making outrageous generalization and we completely forget the fact that many, even most of women, have the choice, and thus they can take the veil away when THEY wish so."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by its followers that matters."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"[link to Raheem Stirling article or other biased media example] Media bias against the Muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more."}
{"HS":"Has our political elite forgotten that we were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principles is to respect human dignity. Islam condemns violence."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"I am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogyny as an exclusively Islamic issue."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Do you have any evidence that Islam is being forced fed? I did not think so."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"No religion encourages violence towards others. I do not think it is a muslim issue at all."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Probably you are making a hasty generalization. I do not think Islam is taking over countries and nations. Do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in UK? How many of them are from EU, muslim community, and other countries?"}
{"HS":"We must eliminate this cult of hate and its supporters. Their literature is all about genocide and hate. Wake up Britain!","CN":"Islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. You can ask any specialist in religion, Islam has nothing to deal with hate. If we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A terrorist cannot be a Muslim since only Allah alone decides the end of all life and condemns any self-proclaimed \"associate\" to hell."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Endangering the lives of Muslims."}
{"HS":"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.","CN":"How many Muslim rapists are there? How many Britain rapists? Compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veiled woman like any human being is free to protect her body as she wishes, she does not want to please, let alone seduce to be able to exist, she wants to be at peace with her conscience."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"This is a thesis contradicted by the reality. Muslim women are at home and elsewhere."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Muslims are citizens like any other and respect the law of the country in which they live according to the verse \"O you who believe! Respect your commitments! \"."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Islam, Christianity and Judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder."}
{"HS":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","CN":"If you really cared about stopping Child Abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. Looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. Shameful!"}
{"HS":"Has our political elite forgotten that we were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"It is nothing."}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"This is their choice and they are free to wear them."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are often highly educated."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"Do you really believe in this statement? Why?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Congratulations you're a philosopher of stupidity."}
{"HS":"In Islam they stone people, especially adulterers.","CN":"Hello, stoning for adultery is a forced reading of the Koran made by extremists over time, but nowhere in the text there is a reference to this type of punishment. Compare extremists and people who practice their faith peacefully is not correct in my opinion."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What about freedom of conscience? Many women wear berets or hats to go unnoticed while preserving their quiet conscience; where is the demonstration of political Islam?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"When we were in the Middle Ages, the 'Islamics' as you call them, lived a period of incredible wealth and prosperity, so I think we should let them in."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Many of them have no home anymore."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Many values"}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what Easter eggs are and what they are for. Deceiving would be just banning the eggs!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"How do you know?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Has anyone ever tried to convert you? Me nobody."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"More than 1,400 years that Islam exists, so over 1,400 years that Islam is political."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Ironically, I think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack Muslims. Intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"But not the ones that fought and died for Britain in both wars and all wars after."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"On what basis do you do these statements? Where are the facts and the data which led you to say that? Should I think that all Italian muslims would kill me because I am Catholic?"}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"For who would represent an enrichment?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Many ists to better support these questionable assertions. The suffix ist has been well selected."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we follow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture?"}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"The UK couldn't thrive without international trade. Trade with Muslim countries boosted our economy to help make Britain as strong as it is today."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"We need Muslims who come to power for that, it is far from being the case."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The level of healthcare response of the Islamic people is similar to ours."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"In that case how do you explain that there are veiled women who are entrepreneurs? Do you know a lot of submissive entrepreneurs? An entrepreneur, by definition, is independent."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. Ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream Islam and happened 15 years ago."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British Asian and abhor FGM. They are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community."}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"Fought for us in both world wars."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Yes but subject to God and not to man."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"An immigrant who commits a crime does not make criminals all his countrymen immigrants like him. Moreover, the crime rate dropped."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"This claim is a scam against freedom of expression, and punishable by law. This, in addition, is completely false since the fraud in any form is banned by Islam."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Those people that we welcome, are persons with their own life, a story often marked by violence suffered, not made."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The Middle Ages was not so negative as a period, Islam has been a cradle of civilization."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"That is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"The Muslim Council of Britain agrees that FGM is against Islamic teachings. Muslims disagree with FGM. Stop spreading negative stereotypes!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Political badges, are they subject to a ban in public places? No!"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Can you tell us what the problem is? Have you personally met such problem?"}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Show me evidence of this?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The fanatics are a small minority."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"These women respect the law and are not the only ones to have a particular dress (this is the case of others like the Christian sisters, some Jewish women, sighs, youth groups, .). No reason to point fingers or discriminate."}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"Every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to Islam."}
{"HS":"Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'.","CN":"The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Throwing the baby out with the bath water creates a useless hate."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"More of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure.

{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It is not true that we maintain them. Only a very small number of asylum seekers are welcomed for a short time (at the expense of the state, but without giving them anything except for a couple of euro daily). The vast majority provides for themselves independently."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"This is just false news! Islam, Christianity and Judaism have the same beginnings and the Koran give special respect to the other two."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"The veil is not intended to prevent women from working, moreover Islam does not forbid them to have a job."}

{"HS":"I've been into Muslim shops in areas of Birmingham and they have refused to serve me. I've even seen signs saying 'No Whites After 8pm'.","CN":"Saw that in the Mirror, bit of graffiti sprawled across a wall, hardly a shop sign. Have you nothing better than false news?"}
{"HS":"Mohammed married a child, he was a pedophile!","CN":"Such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that ."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Do you know the number of Muslims in Italy? I do not believe they are so many to be able to 'impose' Islam on us. Historically are Christians who travel the world trying to convert others."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Excuse me, but why should the Arabs want to conquer us with violence and bombs?"}
{"HS":"No religion claims to be the 'religion of peace' more than Islam. I wonder why they need to keep repeating this?","CN":"Religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorism has no faith and nationality. It's a deviation that takes possession of individuals."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Try to see how many churches there are in Italy and how many mosques. If you lived in Dubai, and the situation was reversed, wouldn't you want that there was at least one church?"}
{"HS":"They are beasts, they keep their women at home and under the veil, then they go out and rape ours.","CN":"It does not seem to me that are Muslims the ones that rape women in Italy."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"What solution do you propose? Do not welcome people who risk their lives to escape from hunger and war? I believe that in our country there is plenty of space to practice Islam without having to convert all of us."}
{"HS":"Shocking. 2 men are murdered in Paris by having their throats cut by some savage shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and the BBC ignore the story. Another cover up.","CN":"The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Sounds more like the Catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #InquiryCSA."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"There is no politics in Islam."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"Any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. If you have faith I am shocked that you would question it."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce."}
{"HS":"Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british!","CN":"Dog's and horse's do not have passports. A stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?"}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times."}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"Did you miss 'Some.' from the beginning of this Tweet?"}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"The percentage of Muslims in Italy is 5%, so I do not think it's possible to think that they are replacing us."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"It is about being uncultured and racist."}
{"HS":"The Muslims are all fanatics and want to rule in our home!","CN":"Oh yes? Then they are in good company of sovereign who would like to close doors and gates."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The Muslims? Which? All? This statement is madness."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"I think the #CatholicChurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"The Islam encourages good behavior towards neighbors, read a little."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They are free to wear it or not."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Atheists like chocolate too!"}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"What is that? Sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"There are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Hello, actually the data show that the majority of immigrants in Italy are Christian-Orthodox and non-Muslim faith: the situation is very diverse and I do not think we can speak of invasion when the number of Muslims in Italy (including Italian citizens) is just under 5%."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Hi, do you think that it's really possible to talk about substitution when the number of citizens of the Muslim faith (including Italian) does not even reach 5% of the total population?"}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? This is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms!"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Seems odd given that Western Society was built on the backs of the rest of the world."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"We are in France; each one chooses the religion he wants. No one to invade anyone, but stupidity and ignorance have invaded your brain."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is a religious sign. It has no connection with politics."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam means peace and like the French republic does, it defends identical values, freedom, fraternity, equality."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"If you like it. Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? If it can be, mix more."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is a form of unabashed racism against Islam!"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Most Muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"You see political Islam everywhere."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"So would the Bible, the Torah, etc."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"To profess and practice their religion is not 'impose' but to exercise, it's an inalienable right."}
{"HS":"If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and \/ or at war?","CN":"The two issues of war\/religion must be disconnected."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Hi, Italy is a laic country, not a Christian country and the majority of our population is still largely Christian, since Muslims do not even reach 5% of all Italian citizens."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Removing the law against the veil would allow them to go back to work."}
{"HS":"How boring these Muslims who put their prophet everywhere!","CN":"Men are to blame if the prophets are too intrusive, in addition to that there is no lack of chauvinism elements in every religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"If someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. But as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful Muslims."}
{"HS":"We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"A good Muslim does not hate anyone, he must be generous and respectful of everyone and let everyone have the freedom to make his choices. We must learn about the pillars of this 1vabt belief of making racist shortcuts."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are in our country."}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"I do not understand your theory, why would it be necessary to make such an atrocity?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"We are already in ours dear French country of Muslim confession."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?"}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You are a victim of Don Quixote syndrome. If you don't know what it is, go read books, cultivate yourself and leave me alone."}

Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Really? Even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our NHS going?

{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"There are more than 800 churches only in Rome, and about 10 mosques (of which only 5 with the minaret). They are a minority: none (that I know) has ever had the need to build a new church, but everyone is entitled to a place where to practice their religion. The fact that the Islamic community requires that their right is respected does not mean that they are becoming more than the Christians, or more powerful."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"Mate, you know Islam means peace. I do not really think a religion born from peace preaches hate speech."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"A little less racism will be good for everyone."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"And the Germans are all Nazis ???"}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No. It is a personal choice. Every woman is and should be free to wear the veil or not."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Have you already forgotten how the Second World War began? By thoughts such as yours."}
{"HS":"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local services. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.","CN":"Sources? This is hatred."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is certain that at this rate, they will be completely rejected, no school outings, no swimming pool, no sports and no job. Whose fault is it?"}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"And so Ghandi said, ' An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"France is my country. I stay there."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Clothing worn by others may bother you, because you are not used to it, but not to attack you. It doesn't make sense."}

{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where I need to be, cook my delicious take away when I haven't got time, teach my children in school. Get the point?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Excuse me but how many Arabs do you know personally?"}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"Before making judgement, do you understand what Islam and its history are?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It does not seem to me that they bring particular diseases."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"What, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Racist sentence that watches bfmtv over and over again."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You have never talked to a Muslim who seemed open you mind?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"These are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths. Although viewed from 'the inside' unlikely to be perceived as 'devout'. More about behaviours than matters of doctrine."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant and understanding people. Look at the bright side!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You can be \"fundamentally\" Islamist and Salafist but in the peaceful way."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"It's right that every religion can have a place of worship in which to profess their beliefs, as required by our constitution."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Support your claim."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Not at all, it is like saying that he who wears a yarmulke is a politician."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"So when there were mafia attacks all the southern people were mobsters?"}
{"HS":"Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam.","CN":"Apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? So surely a country without Islam would be less 'religously' diverse?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Remove the veil that is over your eyes you will see more clearly!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The republic recognizes only citizens and guarantees the free exercise of cults."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society."}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"I invite you to learn more about the Islamic world, you will discover that Muslims are peaceful people and open to dialogue. Unfortunately, there are cases of extremism, but we can fight it using dialogue and cultural exchange."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"It is not very civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"And cyclist too."}

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Unveiled women are equally subjected."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?"}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"This sounds like a science fiction if you ask me!"}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent people from eating during Ramadan.","CN":"Cop\ufffd\ufffd went through that."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"You need to talk to competent people in the Muslim world and you will realize that there is no problem but ignorance."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I'm home. I'm not going anywhere!"}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"I thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"It is a religion that knows how to adapt to its time."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it."}
{"HS":"Muslim males are troglodytes who beat their wives.","CN":"If the word femicide exists in our vocabulary it is because neither the Italian males are so quiet!"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Assuming it was true, you would not see it and it would not be an argument."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"Grow up."}

{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"Replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is."}

{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"The only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the BBC or the Church to shield them."}
{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!","CN":"The value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is a matter of personal choice. It is not important who wears it."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"But 'they kill us' to whom? But when it happened?What are you telling?

{"HS":"Muslims always lie and take advantage of everything.","CN":"Criticism based on prejudice and ignorance."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is a serious human rights abuse. If you really care about stopping it, I think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-Muslim rhetoric."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Dear, the reality is quite different, unfortunately for women, and for all of us, most of the violence is committed by Italians, read here https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/violenza-sulle-donne\/il-fenomeno\/violenza-dentro-e-fuori-la-famiglia\/numero-delle-vittime-e-forme-di-violenza."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes. Criminals are not all of a certain race or religion, but one race and religion produces criminals.","CN":"You seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'God does not love the aggressors.'?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Napalm and weapons do nothing but generate hatred and hatred promotes terrorism. The answer should be just the opposite: try to resolve conflicts."}
{"HS":"They want to convert all of us.","CN":"Maybe it's the right time to begin to pray!"}
{"HS":"The beasts.","CN":"Why do you qualify them as beasts?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am French. I am Muslim. I'm home."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Just to note that muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue."}

{"HS":"Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal!","CN":"Good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-Muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. Oh, wait."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Media is responsible for this speech!"}
{"HS":"Why must Islam invade every country? That is just totalitarian. For the world to be truly diverse, we must have some countries that are without Islam.","CN":"Apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? So surely a country without Islam would be less 'religously' diverse?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam condemns terrorism."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"In the Koran it is clearly said that Christians and Jews should be respected."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of mosques is proportional to the number of Muslims permanently present in our area."}

{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9\/11 in the US and 7\/7 in the UK."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"If you would inform yourself and you would make a comparison between the number of churches and the number of mosques you would understand that what you are saying is false. And the number of mosques is far inferior to the number of churches."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"And reading it we can say that Christians hate Muslims."}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"So more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"For hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of Churches in Britain, but we are better than that now."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Enjoying your afternoon tea?? That came from India."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I am free to live where I want."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"1- No it is not. 2 - An entire faith, really? 5 - Muslims can also be British."}
{"HS":"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?","CN":"Such numbers! Are you sure they are true? Can you give a link to the evidence about that?"}
{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"I'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this."}
{"HS":"Muslims, their texts as hate literature, and other manifestations of hate and genocide should be eradicated. We should have no tolerance towards this cult of hate! Imprison supporters of Islam, wake up Britain!","CN":"In fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. The literature teaches people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. Hence, I do not think we should eradicate the literature."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"There is no contest between mosques and churches."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"I do not think they have an interest in putting the veil on non-Muslim women."}

{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It is you who create problems and controversies to impose on Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Ask them directly!"}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Really? You speak for everyone?"}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"The hatred against the West is not necessarily religious: much of this hatred has been developed as a result of the actions of Western countries at their home."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It makes no sense to say that Muslims are all terrorists. It is to make an amalgam, Muslims are human beings like any others, you can't put everyone in the same direction. We all have our own particularities, we are not a uniform group, we have different backgrounds, different situations and different aspirations."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"For lack of a solution, politicians focus on Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Highlights the ignorance of people."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The number of mosques is proportionate to the amount of Muslims in the area."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The abuse of the mass media seriously affects the capacity for discernment. If the symptoms persist, consult a psychologist. Most likely you became paranoid."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all violent.","CN":"Violence is condemned in Islam."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"False, most Muslims respect republican values."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Islamists represent a very low percentage of the Italian population, there are 10 mosques compared to more than 66,000 churches, so what data are you referring to?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Prove it!"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"On what basis do you do these statements? Actually, there are criminals everywhere and they have different ethnicities and religious affiliations. There are Italian rapists and Catholic priests that are paedophiles. But these cases should not allow us to identify all persons as criminals belonging to these categories."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Children are innocent. They do not deserve terrified treatment. Children are the future. We should offer more hope and brightness to our future."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims have been part of the British fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"Why do you make this statement?"}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!"}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judgement. We should have more faith in English laws and people who execute the laws."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Many women suffer in silence from not being able to dress as they wish in France, the land of freedom! They prefer to keep their conscience clear and give up leisure and sports activities they love, where is politics?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"I hope you do not want to proceed like in China."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggests that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religious affiliation at all."}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"This is simply not true."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"How can you say that they want to kill us all?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?"}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"The war has brought nothing but despair, so why do you say this?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam calls to God: it is a proposal and never an obligation!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"There is no compulsion in Islam, the use of the veil is a personal choice of faith, not required by the husband or the family."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"The very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"We cannot live with so much ignorance, which drives to support such nonsense."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I honestly think that it is better to avoid generalizations: immigration does not mean terrorism."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Fake News."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"It is just a religion like Christianity or any other. Get over it."}
{"HS":"Islam=evil. Islam is invading us and trying to take over countries. It does not follow the scriptures that say 'you shall not envy anyone anything' Stop islam!","CN":"It's too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Why? The Muslims I know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"But which one? I really do not know which to choose!"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Muslim woman + educated woman + valuable woman + educated woman = free woman."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Crime is certainly not the prerogative of migrants, we are well capable of organizing themselves."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is not a disease. It is a religion, and everyone is free to practice it or not."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Yes we are more than 1 billion of terrorists! And it is we who create any conflicts!"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Do you refer to the direct treatment of Muslim populations or perceived as such, the cumulative discrimination, permanent injunctions and daily suspicion? We must stop reversing the prism."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Exclusion Message!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"And you are jealous."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"The values of the Republic"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Muslims recognize all the religions of the book and have to get well with others."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"A 'civilised Europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; Islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"What is the difference between the Christian or Jewish veil?"}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A single counter-example is enough to prove that not all Muslims are terrorists. However, it is not difficult to find a (and even several) neighbour, friend, colleague or acquaintance who is both Muslim and at the same time \"non-terrorist\"."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Wearing a veil, and therefore expressing one's religious opinion is one of the fundamental freedoms of the individual. Each of us expresses his or her individuality. The wearing of the veil, in the same way, is the expression of an individuality."}
{"HS":"I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!","CN":"The terrorist criminals are only extremists parts justified by a deviated reading of Islam."}
{"HS":"Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?","CN":"Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Islam advocates tolerance and respect vis-\ufffd\ufffd-vis non-Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"And you, brave freedom fighters, risk your life to write this message, in complete disregard of the infinite dangers that lie ahead of you for having only dared to utter such words to those who are already, according to your accomplices, the secret masters of the world."}
{"HS":"If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance!","CN":"There is nothing to raise your voice to. Have you ever spoken to your local Muslim community?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Your statement is very strong, based on what do you think that the Arabs want to impose their religion and command at our home? I do not see many Arabs in Italy and I do not even see actions in this direction, but perhaps I was not careful enough, if you helped me with some data I would be grateful."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"This essentialization and criminalization makes the game of the enemies of democracy."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Arabs are a people rich in culture and history and also in contradictions as the so-called Westerns and inciting hatred is uncivilized and blind."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"This is Islamophobic."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Did you know that over 90% of global victims of terrorism are Muslim?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?"}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"That is a sad tragedy. However, the message from Quran is misunderstood. Instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'."}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"I'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a Pakistani Muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly Muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue."}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'Winter Celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). This is all manufactured outrage to create anti-Muslim sentiment. Chill."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Yes, except that HIV is more common among Christians and it's not a contact disease."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"So that will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, Brexit. I did not know these were all down to Muslims! Wow!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Subject? Whose? What? Where? In France? In Saudi Arabia? In short, many questions to be answered. Can we talk? #iammuslim #Askme."}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"That is inaccurate, do your research! Slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The path of integration ensures that the respect for individual human rights is acquired. Living with us, and the example we give in this regard will also open their society."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Violence is a muslim issue. Especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination."}
{"HS":"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight.","CN":"Have you forgotten that this country respects people of all religions?"}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these Muslims that are offended by it? Sounds like fake news to me."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Is the presence of the crucifix the real lack of respect in a laic state."}
{"HS":"Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.","CN":"The often ignored fact is that Muslims are some of the largest victims of ISIS and within the ISIS-controlled community itself."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Good evening, given that not all Arabs are of the Islamic faith. In any case, how are they trying to impose their religion?"}
{"HS":"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites.","CN":"Yes, we do."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Housewife is a whole status."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it's better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"There are Catholic churches all around the world, even in non-Christian countries, so why would it not be correct to allow the construction of mosques in Italy?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"If you continue hating them it can be the case. You should treat people the way that you want to be treated."}
{"HS":"Have Muslims ever made a contribution to our society?","CN":"Fought for us in both world wars."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"I believe that the crucifix in school is a lack of respect for those who are not believers or have a different faith than Christianity."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a religion, its just an excuse for retarded sexual psychopaths, bastards who pollute the world.","CN":"People have the right to belong to any religion they want. If you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad!"}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"I read a lot of resentment in your comment. You would welcome more willingly an alien rather than a person exactly like you, but with a different culture?"}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Oh lately, saying that we welcome them seems an unrealistic claim."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You have forgotten: anthropophagi, Satanists, crypto anarchists, Bolsheviks, Arab Masons (and yes, you have never heard of it, It is a plot!), anti-Semites, murderers. Let's be specific, please!"}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Italy and Italians are and will be whatever they want to be. Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, atheists ."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"No, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilities."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The migrants are fleeing from situations where it was impossible to continue to live, they are leaving everything to board themselves on boats with absent safety standards in hope of finding a country where they can live in peace. I do not think that their purpose is to control and impose their religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"What is the country of Muslims? The musulmanie?"}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"You sure?"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Look at crime stats."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a religion, its just an excuse for retarded sexual psychopaths, bastards who pollute the world.","CN":"That is a misunderstanding. On the contrary, Islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. Is there a particular reason you are picking on Islam?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The largest mosque in Europe built decades ago, is situated in Rome, and has never created problems or competition."}
{"HS":"Islam opposes creativity, since all that is needed is the Koran. It is not a religion, but a system of control.","CN":"Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam defends the values"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The fact that there are criminals of the Muslim religion does not make all Muslims criminals, as well as the fact that there are Catholic criminals, does not make all Catholics criminals."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Do you have proof of what you say?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Which?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Yes, of course, because no one wants to give them a chance to show their competence. The defenders of Islamophobic secularism have locked him up. Fortunately, the rule always has exceptions, you will discover for yourself what veiled women are capable of doing in our neighbourhood!"}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"Given the number of Muslims born in the UK, this statement is a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved."}
{"HS":"This is the ideology of islam: have a mosque, create a community, claim victimhood, gain support from government, exploit laws, establish sharia, take control of the country.","CN":"If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start a new life in a completely new place?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Fortunately not."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"[insert picture of Easter egg labelled as such] Are they?"}
{"HS":"Is it a fundamental principle of Islam that they have to pray in the street, or do they do it just to piss off us infidels?","CN":"Public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to Islam."}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"There are churches in Muslim countries like Turkey, UAE, Morrocco. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"I've never seen a veiled woman invited to a TV set to ask her opinion."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"#islamophobie. This is the climate of intolerance that pushes veiled women to take refuge at home."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"So what about other religious books? They do not belong to our century either?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"To return, I will need a return ticket to France."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"A phrase that denotes a profound ignorance or a perfect bad faith because who offends women are members of the male gender in every place."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"Bit of a generalisation, isn't it? If you cannot see that most Muslims contribute positively to the UK, you need to do a quick google search I think."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"Are you suggesting we should not be democratic? Or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. Perhaps we should try nepotism?"}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Muslims are also average and decent British citizens? Repatriate?"}
{"HS":"\"islamophobia\" is a way to take away our freedom of expression.","CN":"Freedom of expression ends when there is an attack on a religion and a part of the population."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"About 6 million Muslim citizens in France against a dozen 'terrorist' people allows you to soak everyone in the same bath? Nice thinking!"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"There are plenty of examples of Arab people from the second generation, in accordance with their traditions of origin, they are perfectly integrated in Italy."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You're the one who's violating my right."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam asks us to respect the laws of the republic."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Lazy and hateful way to impersonate a feminist activist while overcoming the fight against the problems that affect, in a more structural and comprehensive manner, all the women, violence, harassment, equal pay, gender bias. Such bourgeois feminism is ethnocentric, totally blind to intersectionality."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam means peace, it has never advocated violence, but love, let peace be with you, my brothers and sisters in humanity."}
{"HS":"There should be no Mosque in this country. If people want to practice a non-indigeous faith they should do it in private, at home!!","CN":"Do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? Druids maybe?"}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"No one is offended by people celebrating Christmas. Myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Do you mean the Saudis for arabs?"}
{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'."}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?"}
{"HS":"Islam is like Nazism, it is a cult. Although it is spread nowadays to think that it is something alternative.","CN":"That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence."}
{"HS":"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's.","CN":"You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Why is this a muslim issue? All people from all walks of life can be violent?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"These are all the opposites."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"What kind of problem?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"But our country is here."}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!"}
{"HS":"Islam hates Christians and Jews.","CN":"Only Islam tolerates other religions."}
{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Given the low number of who profess the Islamic faith in Italy, I doubt that this will be the case."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"You mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a medieval religion.","CN":"Islam is a timeless and universal religion."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"They do not lock themselves in the house. They are persecuted on a daily basis, from the simple glance to physical aggression. They cannot even practice the sport of their choice."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Muslims are subject to a religion, as a person can be in his or her daily life to that democracy or whatever."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Not at all it is a religious obligation and not a political one."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Last time I heard Muslims came into Europe to help rebuild it after WW2 when Europeans blew each other up."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"No one wants to impose anything on anyone. Arabs living in Italy want to live in peace, respecting the law and all citizens, but why do you have this huge desire to find an enemy?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Is not the fear of difference that makes you say that?"}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"When was the last time you read any holy book? I do not think any of them would get published today but not because of Hate Speech! Without faith they're just not great reads!"}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"And Trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including Robert De Niro, those individuals do not represent all of Trump's supporters though."}
{"HS":"A recent YouGov survey shows that Westerners view islam less favourably than other religions, deeming it incompatible with Western values.","CN":"The horrors of Daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of Islam proliferating in both online and offline media. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really."}
{"HS":"Muslims are staining the world, they are sexual maniacs with psychopathic tendencies. They use their religion as an excuse!","CN":"I know many Muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. You should not insult people based on their religion."}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"Islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. Muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. Which of those would you like to get rid of?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"Get out of your cave and especially turn off your TV!"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"It seems to me an excessive alarmist statement, with no connection to reality."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A non-Muslim who commits a massacre is just a fool or a criminal."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is better than a monastery!"}
{"HS":"Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.","CN":"That is a sad tragedy. However, the message from Quran is misunderstood. Instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Really? Hundreds of millions of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are anti-semitic.","CN":"During the Nazi period, Muslims have voluntarily protected the Jews."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Why is there a problem?"}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"Even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in 2017. Stop blaming others and help our girls and women."}
{"HS":"Islam purpose is only the conquest.","CN":"No, Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Where do we deport the Muslims who were born here to?"}
{"HS":"I think is common sense to have prejudice about Islam. This isn't racism because Islam is a cult.","CN":"Yes you can. Bigotry is bigotry."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam does not invade France. It is the incitement to hatred that maintains this impression. Knowing each other is the way of mutual respect and interpersonal relationships. You will see that Muslims live their faith in peace and respect for the freedoms of others."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Media: spreading fear of Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"The best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Or a trump rally."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"The vast majority of Global Terrorism is about politics and land not faith. One fact you do not seem to want to deal with."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"#islamophobia. The problems that come first in the daily lives of French people are employment, purchasing power and not communitarianism."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"The majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful."}
{"HS":"They constantly say that their religion is a 'religion of peace', maybe because in reality it isn't.","CN":"Religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace."}
{"HS":"They will blow all of us up.","CN":"Do you really think that they have so many bombs?"}
{"HS":"Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK!","CN":"Did history teach you nothing? How can you say this about an entire group of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"My country is France. Sorry musulmanie does not exist."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"So, the best solution to get them out of this submission would make them feel guilty in public spaces systematically, to insult them permanently denying their integration and willingness to aspire to a decent life? Funny as a way to inclusiveness, and a way out of someone's submission."}
{"HS":"When we welcome Muslims in our country we welcome paedophiles, rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia.","CN":"We also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. You cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Larousse or Robert?"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Stereotype."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there have been knife and gun issues over the last 20 years."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Which one? A religion has no borders, no more than any other belief or thought, whether religious or not."}
{"HS":"Whether you accept it or not, people are concerned with Islamic rape gangs and the spread of extremism.","CN":"I noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. Actually, Muslims are kind and sincere. However, people usually can access only negative events and issues about Islam and do not consider good news meaningful. We do not want only fear to exist in the society. Hence, we should help people know about Islam and Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"You speak on behalf of women whose rights are being violated, that's fine. What about women who choose to wear it?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Great things."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Why must we create a competition between different religions? Wouldn't it be better to establish a peaceful coexistence?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Just like you, veiled women are endowed with free will. Wearing the veil or not is a personal decision."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"To ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more than a bit unfair?"}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"Your position is clearly the result of insecurity against these people who have nothing less of us. They are human beings with a different religion and habits, but nothing less than us. We are all human beings!"}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"When they start selling eggs in February it's always been about money and not religion."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"Actually, I think that the whole point of #VisitMyMosque is to ask questions."}
{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the Western values you mean?"}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It must be understood that these same women have a brain like the others that they went to school and that they have the same weapons as other women, not to confuse them with immigrants."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"A civil country must take care of all the people present in the area, as you and I receive education and free medical care, everyone has the right to access them. The crimes committed by migrants are a very low percentage, and murders can be counted on the fingers of one hand."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Then the violent protesters in support of tommy were muslims?"}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. Islam is no different."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"I never answer that statement because it is an irrational statement."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"Many Muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. It is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes."}
{"HS":"If we want to solve the problem with islam and sharia we should deport them. Even if I respect Muslims that are peaceful I think that priests are trying to start a war. Islam is a worship.","CN":"You cannot blame all people for the actions of a few. Banning something altogether will not solve anything."}
{"HS":"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight.","CN":"There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"There is no danger of starving for 18,000 disembarkation a year, don't worry."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."}
{"HS":"Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?","CN":"Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"And Jews are stingy? Stop your clich\ufffd\ufffds."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Aren't there a lot of people in Britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? Or is that different?"}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is a crime like any form of racism."}
{"HS":"We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"My optician seems like a nice fellow, so I wonder why you think he is likely to kick off at a moment's notice."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Muslims are an integral part of the French system, they do not benefit from it any more than they contribute to it."}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it's better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc.","CN":"White men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the Church and Hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. Why aren't you angry about that?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It is a message of provocation and hatred."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Good evening, what is the connection between Islam and the return of hunger and disease?"}
{"HS":"We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.","CN":"The same Islamic leaders assert that this is not true, rather over time has been given a sexist reading to the Koran that has conveyed certain messages."}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace, love and brotherhood."}
{"HS":"Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves.","CN":"It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promotes this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslim religion is not a country."}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"But like any religious concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries!","CN":"Why should someone who is working \/ studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The Quran says that the good Muslim can only transmit the principles of Islam, but without using force, if someone follows another religion, he can do it. There is no mention about killing those who do not believe in the same principles."}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"Have you actually spoken with Muslim about this? Do people celebrating Christmas actually offend them? I would be keen to know."}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"It is quite literally not."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Who exterminated the American Indians? Who exterminated the Jews of Europe? Who exterminated the peoples of Africa? Muslims perhaps."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Start with the madness you have reached."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Like the man, veiled women are subject only to god."}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"There's a league table?"}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It suits me so well!"}
{"HS":"I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.","CN":"I read in your words a total rejection of Muslims, but I do not understand why: the Muslims are men like many others in the world who believe in a monotheistic religion and practice it, that is far from being devoted to violence or abuse as some of the most violent minorities that maybe you are referring to."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Last I checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. Much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on Muslims and other minority communities to try to paint a false image. Don't be fooled by their fake news."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Those who run away from war and hunger do not impose anything on anyone, they do not have the forces to control anything."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"In the Quran, there is no sura ordering Muslims to kill people who do not believe in Allah. There is also a chapter which enunciates a principle of religious tolerance."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If they were all terrorists there would be millions of terrorists on earth today! Let's lock them all up!"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"If anything, we women must express what is harmful to us."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Hi, data actually affirm that most of the immigrants are of Orthodox Christian faith and Muslims are less than 5%. In addition to the fact that those who claim to want to impose sharia does not seem like they really inspire from the assertions made by their religion."}
{"HS":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","CN":"Do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by Muslims? What do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Arabs have no interest in conquering Europe. The majority want to live in peace, as the majority of Italians."}

{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"And pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, terror in all its forms must be defeated. No use just blaming Muslims."}
{"HS":"Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam.","CN":"I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spread of a particular faith or belief, but isn't' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"From a presumed behavior you erect a rule that will block them even more?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"On the same boat is a saying that should unite and remember that luck is a fickle thing."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Housewives is a choice and not related to a religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Look at the number of Muslims in the world, I hope not."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Ultimately, the Muslims want to either convert us or kill us.","CN":"The vocation of Islam is not to force anyone to do anything."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Are you sure about this? Have you interviewed every single person in this country? Tell me more about this."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"If any Muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. Perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right?"}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Hatred does nothing but feed hatred."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"You see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in?"}
{"HS":"The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult!","CN":"The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but if someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"False."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"False for the most part they work, if not, it is a choice."}
{"HS":"Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law.","CN":"Can somebody not love their faith and their country (UK)?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The first victims of terrorists are Muslims. Are you sure?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"If you really want to send them back, it costs less a plane ticket than a trip on the boat. Do you know that only the wealthiest can come to Italy, many of whom have graduated from university? Try to imagine if the same treatment was reserved for our 'brain-drain' abroad."}
{"HS":"The purpose of Islam is to take control of our country: they are trying to have the support of our government and when they will have it they are going to establish sharia and dominate our country.","CN":"Is it facts or just your imagination? I do not agree that they aim to take control of us. Maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"A Muslim by definition is the opposite of terror."}
{"HS":"Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting!","CN":"Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"Saw that in the Mirror, bit of graffiti sprawled across a wall, hardly a shop sign. Have you nothing better than false news?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Biased media coverage over-represents Muslims as committing these crimes. How much media attention does the Vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Where do we deport the Muslims who were born here to?"}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"I thought the association of Eggs with the celebration of Easter originally derived from Pagan, pre-Christian practices?"}
{"HS":"Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you!","CN":"May I remind you to mind your language? Do you want to share me with your anger, maybe I can help you?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"This is impossible because men are free to choose their religion."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Veiled women are free to cover and not to be a sex object."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"If we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories of the 1970's, for example, it's a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grandkids as an invasion or a plague, don't you think?"}
{"HS":"Is it a fundamental principle of Islam that they have to pray in the street, or do they do it just to piss off us infidels?","CN":"Never mind a bit of praying in public, how do we stop the Salvation Army waking us up on a Sunday with 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. A working man deserves a lie-in!"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Education of children."}
{"HS":"Thousands of British girls are raped, enslaved or murdered by Muslims and other non-British immigrants. Woe to thee!","CN":"Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes."}
{"HS":"They should open the mosques at their homes.","CN":"People who can practice their religion are people who feel respected and therefore they respect and learn to respect people of different religions."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I find your statement neither acceptable nor true, a large share of economic resources devoted to immigrants comes from Europe."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"So all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? I do not think so!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many Muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating Islam: https:\/\/5pillarsuk.com\/2019\/01\/03\/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester\/."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by US and UK intelligence agencies. Are you sure it is Muslims we need to be worried about?"}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Women are very precious in Islam and they are valued."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"No connection between religion and politics. It is a personal journey to his faith quite simply!"}

{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"These are shameful and horrendous crimes, many times perpetrated within the home and within the family."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What do you have of Islam, apart from what the media conveys? Oh yes, couscous!"}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Are you sure it is not just that Muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage?"}
{"HS":"They want to convert all of us.","CN":"Can you tell me about an incident in which you found yourself living an attempt of conversion?"}

{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"No one wants to have more places of worship for others. There are citizens who want a place of worship close to home."}

{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Your statement is a lawsuit."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"In Italy we have had no recent attack by Arabs. Moreover, even in European countries where these despicable events took place, it was not an action of conquest, but only terrorist actions."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Many immigrants as you say that 'land massively in our country' are of Christian faith."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Start by understanding why and you'll be smarter."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Muslims are people of peace."}
{"HS":"Isis bride supported Isis and now that Isis is defeated, she wants to pass on our side. She does not have any rights! Let her die!","CN":"This isn't really about the class as such, more about a country's responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens."}
{"HS":"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?","CN":"Because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith."}
{"HS":"Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam!","CN":"My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. Anyone else a fan of Monty Python?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"The criminals are of all populations and all religions, fortunately, a minority, you should never generalize. You are Italian, so you are a mobster?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"The Koran does not order war at all but peace and a gentle word. Allah says in the Qur'an: \"By wisdom and good exhortation, call people to the path of your Lord. Discuss with them in the best way\" (Sura 16 years-Nahl, verse 125)"}

{"HS":"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan.","CN":"So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"You decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? Well, this is not a way forward."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"Who are 'all them violent muslims'? Are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not?"}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"Hi, I read a lot of anger in this comment, could you explain it better to me?"}
{"HS":"They will blow up all of us in order to force us to their faith.","CN":"Unfortunately, terrorism is a reality, but it has nothing to do with religious faith. The terrorists, the fanatics, the violent exist in every country, in every culture, in every religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims conceived the slave trade.","CN":"Slavery long predated Islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. Way ahead of the rest of the world."}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"Statistics and facts simply prove this wrong."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"It does not seem to me that the majority of Muslims are so intolerant against our society. We cannot confuse a few extremists with those who peacefully practice their religion."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Italy is, according to our constitution, a lay state. Christianity is the majority religion, and will remain so as long as most people continue to practice it. Our law protects the right of everyone to practice their religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Islam is an integral part of the history of the nation."}
{"HS":"They constantly say that their religion is a 'religion of peace', maybe because in reality it isn't.","CN":"Maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about Muslim?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It is the fear of the unknown that makes you say that."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Try to inform yourself and you will see that it is not so. Indeed, precisely because the mosques are not so common it is difficult for many Italian Muslims to reach their place of worship."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, they carry it in their soul and in their conscience."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it's better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people."}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Punishing the 'Many' for the sins of the 'Few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in?"}
{"HS":"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?","CN":"No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Child sex abuse happens in all religions. You only have to look at what the Vatican covers up to see that."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"A small number of asylum seekers is effectively maintained for a short period. This is just to prevent that, lying on the street and in trouble, they'll end up becoming criminals. The bulk of crime made by immigrants is not the work of this category, but of irregulars (which are not maintained by anyone)."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"It's not an us and them thing. We are all just trying to get on and make a living. You do not do that by putting anyone down."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"This thought is the beginning of the path that leads to racism."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"My place and my world is the planet Earth."}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"Religions also promote arts, sciences, and help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair."}
{"HS":"Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you!","CN":"You have a stance, that is your right. But it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Loving one's fellow is one of the mottos of Islam, especially for the foreigners."}
{"HS":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","CN":"An ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but it's not the ideology that matters, it is how followers act it out."}
{"HS":"Muslims must integrate or leave France!","CN":"Muslims are French citizens, like all citizens of other faiths, religion can't call into question the nationality or citizenship guaranteed by the French Republic."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Asian CSE offenders represent 0.01% of the UK's Asian population' - there are no more Muslim rapists than there are non-Muslim rapists, proportionally.

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Could you give me your data with the sources? Thank you very much."}
{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!","CN":"These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of Islam? Would you think that about any other religion?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Ignorance of the Muslim religion, Islam is a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What party? How to join?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Submission does not manifest itself in a dress, it would be so easy to find the perpetrators by this principle."}
{"HS":"These Islamists only think about stealing.","CN":"An opinion based on nothing but hatred and prejudice."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"The choice to wear the veil is free and it is up to Muslim women."}
{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!","CN":"Sexualization of children is a modern value? Do you actually know what is meant by values?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Think that Italians get married, but then they kill them with their children."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate?"}
{"HS":"How can we fight anti-Semitism when city ghettos of Birmingham, Bradford, etc. Are full of anti-Semitic Pakistani muslims? Labour is lost to the mix of Radical Islam\/middle class.","CN":"Sociological research shows that Western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. Thus, we cannot say that Muslims prevent the white people from getting the position."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? Call me sceptical."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Locked up? Strange, I saw one outside earlier? Oh, yeah, I see it was my dentist."}
{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Explain? Such offensive language and diversity is a strength."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I am a Muslim and I am the Sunna of my Prophet Mohammed."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"Methodist, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Catholic, Protestant, there are different types of Christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think Islam would be different?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"You would really use incendiary bombs to set fire to people because someone among them could have mental problems?"}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"But the illnesses have a religious origin? Do we expect their return according to the religion?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They are weak and reduce prejudice."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"You can be Islamophobic in your inner self but you can't encourage others to do that."}

{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"Do you actually expect people to believe a fact THIS fake? At least try and think of a believable percentage."}
{"HS":"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.","CN":"Certainly terrorism is a phenomenon that can and should worry, but it is kept under control and it is very unlikely that we will come to these levels."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"Muslims also contribute a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"The constitution and the laws guarantee the freedom to manifest one's own religion and therefore the use of the veil."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"As if an American says 'Italians are all mobsters, we must respond with napalm'."}
{"HS":"Muslims in China were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol during the recent Chinese New Year celebration - At least China is doing it right!!","CN":"Doing it right'? I think you have got your moral compass upside down!"}

{"HS":"No religion claims to be the 'religion of peace' more than Islam. I wonder why they need to keep repeating this?","CN":"Maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not?"}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"I have known many Muslims, some of them were even Italian. No one of them has ever tried to kill me because I'm Catholic."}

{"HS":"Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"Must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Articles showing the opposite."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam is a religion and cannot invade anyone. Islamization is an invented term that makes no sense. The only reason you want to have such comments is because you don't know what they are."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The problem lies in having a more open, secular and human mentality without blinders."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Don't thongs assault you?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is a choice for the woman and a garment of piety that testifies her devotion to the Lord."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. Cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Fake news and fearmongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It is the media that feed this fear."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The number of incoming Muslims is too small to make significant changes in our society and healthcare."}

{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"People are people with evil ones in every community. Misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is a respectable choice."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"Photo? Evidence? Did you report them? Or just another internet myth."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I think it's better to learn to live together instead. Sending them home without reason is equivalent to rejecting them and the rejection generates resentment."}
{"HS":"We cannot live with a religion that blows up his believers!","CN":"I invite you to do some research and find out that Islam is a peaceful religion and its believers do not blow themselves up, but they are open to dialogue."}
{"HS":"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"I do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"No, Muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within Europe, integrating with little issues in various European societies."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Terrorists would be very happy if this was the case."}
{"HS":"People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it.","CN":"As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors."}
{"HS":"If they love Sharia law so much, why do not they go off and live in a Muslim country?","CN":"Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What republic? We're going straight to a dictatorship!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"What about other dressing styles that are not common in some cultures?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Start with Islamophobia, a real scourge."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The true Islam does not coincide with the alleged version that those who kill in the name of their religion claim to be inspired by."}
{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"We also bombard Lombardy because there are corrupts and Campania because there is the Camorra? For a few guilty we cannot generalize."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Women gained more rights in Islam than in any other religion."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"I agree that ISIS is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the UK is just plain silly."}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Actions of a few people do not represent an entire community."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"The negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all Muslims. Don't believe everything you read."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"False. You can not stereotype everyone in the same category."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"As is paranoia."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"What do you mean? Provide positive news story re islam."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"The issue of the Islamic veil is complex, it is not a religious prescription but cultural. Islam has within itself many different positions on the subject."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"Yeah, so what is your point? It looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the West."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Muslims have been in Europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Whatever."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Most French Muslims were born in France, how do they actually return home?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Muslims cannot use force to spread their principles, a sura of the Koran says that. Also, another sura proclaims religious tolerance."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Well most Muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are proud to be British, work hard and and contribute to the economy."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"History shows that this is false: Muslims pacts guaranteeing peaceful coexistence (Constitution of Medina, etc.)"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"They do not seem to do all this to me. We must work to find common agreement."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people."}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"Islam is a religion of tolerance and light. The contribution of Muslim scholars to the well-being of humanity is known. Any obscurantism has nothing to do with this current."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"We already have the Republic's values. Such as respecting the religions of others."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Meaningless statement."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I think it's best to check before making certain statements. I've never heard of Muslims who would have reduced someone to hunger or would have sent illnesses typical of their religious affiliation here in Italy."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"It was non-Muslims who opened the practice of terrorism."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Yes. And Mickey Mouse wants to shoot Pluto! But go and tell this to the Beagle Boys."}
{"HS":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy.","CN":"Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Racist clich\ufffd\ufffd."}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"The practice of Islam does not prevent us from living together and everyone's belief is secular."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"Appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy?"}
{"HS":"Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. )","CN":"I'd rather see them than the Friday night kicking out crowd."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"You speak as if it was a cause-effect phenomenon, but it is not so! I see everyday people go to work and have all the colors: white, yellow and black. I see refugees in my university, in the workplace, and they never harmed a hair to me."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"What about recent school and mall shootings all over the US? Those were White Christian terrorists."}
{"HS":"Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact!","CN":"Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is a religion entirely compatible with the values"}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist."}
{"HS":"Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death.","CN":"How does a religion cause death? Sounds a bit extreme, no?!"}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"Provide facts."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"It is becoming comical."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The most severe forms of violence are made by partners, relatives or friends. The rapes are committed by partners in 62.7% of cases, in 3.6% and 9.4% by relatives of friends. We are talking about Italians."}
{"HS":"I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you!","CN":"What happened, my friend? Do you want to talk about what is in your mind?"}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"The Yorkshire Ripper' said God told him to commit his atrocities. In neither case is this a justification. Individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on.","CN":"How can you say such hateful things about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is freedom of worship."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"Don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by Muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics)"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Not all Muslims commit such terrible crimes, we must respect those that want to integrate normally doing nothing wrong."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Political Islam is a pretext for the opression of Muslim citizens."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Do you know the number of crimes committed by migrants? And those committed by Italians? Crime has no culture or ethnicity, has a social origin."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"From where do you get this opinion?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact!","CN":"Evidence? All hatred is wrong and must be countered."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"In my opinion you attribute to Islam a power which it does not have, the maldistribution of wealth and thus of the access to food and water must be ascribed to the local governments and to the excessive power of the multinationals; it is like saying that we will suffer from hunger and diseases because of Christians or Buddhists or Hindus."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"The only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. This is not a society where I want to live."}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"Uhm, Maths."}
{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"Learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? I strongly disagree."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? Really?"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"As is paranoia."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"We are a civilized country, why should we deny the construction of places of worship to religious communities?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Stop the slander and rumors."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"So race hate started when Westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs?"}
{"HS":"It is one law for Muslims and another law for us.","CN":"Evidence please?"}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Yet it has been going very well for a long time, strange your tweet."}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"Do you think making children suffer will make a religion, Islam, or our world better? I think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Ethnic origin and religious affiliation cannot be superimposed, as the same country may have people of different denominations. This is also what makes our sweet France so rich."}
{"HS":"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.","CN":"The best answer to this fear is to defend your religion, not attack Islam; do you attend church regularly?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"And Trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including Robert De Niro, those individuals do not represent all of Trump's supporters though."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Have you ever spoken with a woman who wears it? No, that for sure!"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"So because of Red Brigades also all Italian would be terrorists, because of IRA even all Irish and due to the ETA even all Spanish? In short, here in Europe, we are quite dangerous!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"This type of statement categorizes an entire population without any basis."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"At what level? Do you really know the values of the Republic where Islam starts by knowing the motto! That's all said and done."}

{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Amalgam Islam and Muslims."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"In countries like France at school it is forbidden any religious symbol, from the crucifix to the islamic veil."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!"}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"That is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics)"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"I don't think responding to violence with violence has ever solved the problem; I wish however to point out that generalizations like the one you made are misleading, some Arabs are terrorists, as some Italians are mobsters, but not all Arabs are terrorists and not all Italians are mobsters."}
{"HS":"All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","CN":"Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all the same.","CN":"No, people with Muslim faith are as diverse as everyone else."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a bestial cult of brainwashed lunatics who breed like rats.","CN":"Are you sure? 12 Muslim Nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Islam is all about love and tolerance [insert quote]."}
{"HS":"Above all Islam is a religion of conquest.","CN":"So are we forgetting about the Crusades then."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Or maybe they actually ARE the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Rather, it is diverted secularism or globalization that destroys the religions and identities of people."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Many of the recent Islamist terrorist attacks were not made by Arabs. For example, Turks, Iranians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc. Are not Arabs."}
{"HS":"The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people!","CN":"Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?"}
{"HS":"Islam and peace cannot coexist!","CN":"Iceland and Switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'Global Peace index'. Both have Muslim populations."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorists are misguided Muslims."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"We are supposed to be in a free country, everyone has the right to dress as they please."}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"There's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Good evening, Islam is a religion and as in any faith there are fanatical believers, not all Muslims are fanatics."}
{"HS":"The myth is that Islam is an alternative culture, but the truth is that it a barbarism, an ideology similar to Nazism.","CN":"Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!"}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"A person who believes in a peaceful religion based on love, brotherhood and dedication to God in your opinion deserves to die for it?"}
{"HS":"Shocking. 2 men are murdered in Paris by having their throats cut by some savage shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and the BBC ignore the story. Another cover up.","CN":"The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Bring your proof."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is synonymous with freedom, how does it assault you?"}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc.","CN":"#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!"}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Another rapist from England. We should ..."}

{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"No, it is not true."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"And the Catholic veil?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"While newspapers tend to look for a link between the presence of foreign citizens and the increase of diseases, I think that we should be more cautious because no research shows this bond."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."}
{"HS":"These 8 crooks are all Muslims and every one of their victims is Non-Muslim, white-British. Why do these criminals only target White British Non-Muslims?","CN":"They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"There are extremists but also many people who live peacefully."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Do you have any statistics that prove that they are all terrorists? Or are you just generalizing."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Muslims fought 2 wars in France and helped to rebuild France but that's because they hate the French."}
{"HS":"Muslim men are violent, Muslim women are subjected.","CN":"Are there statistics on perpetrators of violent acts against women, that allow us to say that?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Veiled women are active."}

{"HS":"Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.","CN":"What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"How have you come to this decision?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"It does not appear to me that there is a correlation between Islam and crime: it seems to me rather that there is a correlation between poverty and crime, and genocide is not a great solution to this problem ."}
{"HS":"Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam.","CN":"British Muslims contribute 31 billion to the UK economy and you'd call that a threat?"}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. When a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist.

{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Why are you shocked by Muslim veil when the veil exists in other religions as well?"}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"I do not know if it counts as invasion when lots of Muslims in the UK are British citizens and were born here."}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Similarly, your string may be uncomfortable to other people."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will.

{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Have you ever seen a veiled woman in the National Assembly?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Many companies refuse to hire qualified women for the position precisely because they wear the veil. Maybe we should start with this?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"The veil is not a prison, and does not prevent the woman from doing a professional associative activity, etc. Islam encourages work."}

{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The existence of some fanatics cannot make us throw the baby out with the bathwater. It would be like saying all Italians are mobsters."}
{"HS":"He has found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam.","CN":"My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape.

Islam is a death cult!","CN":"That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"It's not just Muslims who rape women. The punishment that you propose does not seem effective to me. The judge of a court decides the real punishment for a rapist."}
{"HS":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","CN":"Sounds like incitement to me."}
{"HS":"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?","CN":"Yes, we do."}
{"HS":"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!","CN":"Where did you obtain this information from? Did you check if your source was reliable, because the official data deny an increase of the Muslim immigrant population in Italy."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"The thong is an assault against me. Half naked women placed on posters are also an assault against me."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"The companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. It is not necessary to attribute everything to the Muslim invasion."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Seriously, it does not hold, Islam is a religion not a political party. Rather, the pseudo-experts of Islam that run repeatedly on television politicize the issue."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"That is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Who are you talking to, please?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Stop looking bfm."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"But every human being is free in its practice."}
{"HS":"If they love Sharia law so much, why do not they go off and live in a Muslim country?","CN":"Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"And views like that, that lumps all Muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Terrorism has no ethnic origin. Terrorism is a problem but ethnicity, religion, skin colour, borders are not."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"Why? What is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"There will be millions of them on earth to help."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"Sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"What makes you think that Muslims want us to adapt to their culture?"}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"How is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Violence is always wrong. Also it's repudiated in our constitution. This post is therefore contrary to the principles at the basis of our state."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Are you sure? There are an awful lot of Muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Islam isn't a retrograde religion. For nearly a thousand years, the heart of technological and philosophical development took place in the Arab countries after the collapse of the Roman Empire, while in Europe we lived in the dark ages. Large part of common opinion over Islam are prejudices."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"No, I just cannot because I am an Arab outside and a French inside."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"The real problem is that you spend your time hating us."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is an insult to the freedom of conscience of Muslim women."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"An unveiled woman is subject to human eyes, a veiled woman is free of it."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the UK economically and culturally."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The hunger is already suffered by a considerable part of humanity, including diseases, so we have to worry about the existence, regardless of ethnic and religions."}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"I do not believe that this is the meaning of Islam; and for the more progressive Islam, the veil is an individual choice, not an imposition."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"There are a hundred similar images of Christian including those in the KKK standing next to their victims who used the Bible as a justification. Of course none of us believe they represent all Christians."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Its equivalent in the Christian religion?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to God."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"How a peaceful religion could bring back a civilized country in the Middle Ages?"}
{"HS":"I think is common sense to have prejudice about Islam. This isn't racism because Islam is a cult.","CN":"The semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there."}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!","CN":"These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?"}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"I saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? That was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not constitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!"}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"They are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work in our factories, NHS and transport."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"The problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your Islamophobia. Fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Why is this a muslim issue? A faith of 1.6 billion all violent?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"What frightens me personally is the ignorance you proudly display in the eyes of the world."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Italy is a laic country."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I agree that it is our fault if you have a total lack of culture on ISLAM, I invite you to drink a tea with me for some clarifications."}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"I think that it is very offensive to compare men to animals."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"You do not know maybe, but Islam is a religion, not a nationality."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Well the Home Office would say differently, but if it helps your cause."}
{"HS":"The purpose of Islam is to take control of our country: they are trying to have the support of our government and when they will have it they are going to establish sharia and dominate our country.","CN":"Substitute 'Christianity' and 'Church' for 'Islam' and 'Mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of Africa and Indian by the British empire."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"What about nuns?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"They don't want to see us in the public space anymore."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"This is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office?"}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"The one about the crucifix removed from schools is a fake news that people like a lot at Christmas."}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?"}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith."}
{"HS":"They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Ultimately, the Muslims want to either convert us or kill us.","CN":"In Islam it is forbidden to kill or harm the human being!"}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?"}
{"HS":"Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. )","CN":"At what point in history did England not have people from other places joining us? Vikings, Saxons, Romans. We integrate the best things and move forward."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"A Muslim does not have a country of his own! A native French man with another religion can convert to Islam if he wishes: in this case he will go or?"}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"Sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"So, no one is 'maintaining' the migrants, is part of the temporary shelter project. Migrants are human beings and do not kill anyone."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Not all Muslims are fundamentalists."}
{"HS":"If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away.","CN":"One of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. Maybe if you made Muslims feel more welcome, they would?"}
{"HS":"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites.","CN":"Many victims of terror are Muslim."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Muslims don't hate Christians, generalization is never good!"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Media and politics divide the French."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"All the people from Pakistan that I know are really nice! No need to generalize too much!"}
{"HS":"Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult.","CN":"Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners."}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"And when CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a Muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against Muslim women."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"It would be like saying that all Italians are mobsters and kill people with a shotgun or dissolve children in acid. You can never generalize."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Why can't we try to live peacefully each one with their own culture?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"We give migrants room and board only if they are asylum seekers and roughly only for the duration of the analysis of the request."}
{"HS":"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!","CN":"There is a solution to violence, that is the dialogue. We must try to communicate with people who have different cultures, not isolate ourselves."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The Middle Ages is not represented by professing one religion instead of another, it is rather represented by discriminating on the basis of someone's faith."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Refuse to work do they? But at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. Tricky one that!"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I was born here so I'm home!"}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"Clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.Why so negative?"}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"Unfortunately some malicious Muslims enjoy some social benefits. But this is unacceptable. This is not a reason to stigmatize Islam."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Truly, if we come back to the Middle Ages, I would hope to finish in the Islamic world. They are the ones who brought us out of the dark ages. The Islamic world after the Roman Empire and before the Enlightenment was the cradle of humanity, for almost a thousand years."}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"Every Muslim is a potential peace advocate as well."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It has nothing to do with politics."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Castration is not provided by our legal system."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Where do you see all this? Frankly, I do not find feedback to your statements."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"When you drink booze, it goes back to your brain."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"When will we fight your words?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Muslims contribute much to Europe and have done since the 19th Century."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Let's talk about it so I can prove otherwise."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"No, veiled women like all other women need opportunities while respecting their religion."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The Arabs do not want to impose their religion. Did you see any Muslim in Italy trying to impose his religion on anyone? If so, where? Explain his theory. The boats are controlled by human traffickers, so you would like that trafficking of human beings was used to bring them back to their homeland?"}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Inciting genocide is a crime under international law."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from Islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"It is no more totalitarian than any other religion. Only extremists using Islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. These aren't reflective of the majority of Muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"If that were the case, it would be uniform. Now all shapes and colors are present."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Numerous studies have shown that there is no link between the increase in the number of foreign citizens and the supposed return of diseases that seemed outdated."}
{"HS":"#visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc.","CN":"If you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"First learn what a Muslim is before judging."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law.","CN":"Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Islam is a religion and not a nationality."}
{"HS":"Muslims benefit from the French system.","CN":"The citizens of a nation (of any religion) are entitled to enjoy their rights conferred by the taxes collected."}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Statistics say that Italy is last in the list of countries that welcome migrants and refugees with only 2.4 people per 1,000 inhabitants. Insert links, for example https:\/\/www.internazionale.it\/reportage\/annalisa-camilli\/2018\/06\/18\/immigrazione-luoghi-comuni-italia."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Do not hesitate to seek medical advice if you see things that do not exist."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"What exactly is the West going to 'win'? Muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing division."}
{"HS":"Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries' territory. Stop Islam spreading!","CN":"Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions."}
{"HS":"I think is common sense to have prejudice about Islam. This isn't racism because Islam is a cult.","CN":"I mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"All women who wear a veil are considered dangerous in France today."}
{"HS":"(responding to a terrorist attack :) still a Buddhist, and they want us to believe that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.","CN":"Read for yourself and you will understand the Qur'an."}

{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"Many Muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. Maybe we should invite more?"}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"That is very inflammatory. Have you got any reputable news sources to support that? Or is this just Islamophoic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Although there are certainly Muslims who have committed horrendous crimes, I find it unfair to generalize and condemn an"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Some of the oldest civilisations in existence are Islamic. I would not call the religious hatred directed at Muslims in Europe 'civilised'."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"No muslim. The majority of Muslims in France are French and Republicans."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Do you have any proof?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Are all priests pedophiles?"}
{"HS":"Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact!","CN":"Do you know the numbers of the votes of Britain Muslims?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Good evening, from your comment I deduce that rape Italian women should not be so much violent mens, but members of the Islamic religion. So is it something related to religion? Not a sexist and violent culture?"}
{"HS":"They impose on us their culture.","CN":"The cultures can co-exist if there is the value of mutual respect."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"To me it does not seem that my friends that wear veils are offended when they see other people without it, they got the license, they go out on their own and travel. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Would you like to point out where in the Koran it commands rape gangs? Just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"In Europe we have different forms of terrorism eta, ira, even in Italy we have had various forms of terrorism, black and red. Even the Mafia has used terrorist strategies."}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have invaded our country.","CN":"Islam has only learned respect and prohibits violence."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Apart from all the scientists that are also muslim?"}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"The question of the veil is open. The same Muslim women in some countries are struggling to get rid of it, for example, in Iran. We have to support their struggle."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"The Arabs that are in Italy want better working and living conditions than those in their country. Certainly, they do not aim to command at our house."}

{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"God loves you, that's why."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Pure Islamophobic ideology."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is not Islam that has imposed itself in the political spheres but the will of unscrupulous human beings to show this religion and these practitioners with their fingers."}
{"HS":"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.","CN":"My friend, this world is not perfect. It experienced world wars I and II, economic recession, political crisis, etc. Us is a Christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. Islam cannot explain all of these."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth and are we going back to the Middle Ages? Who commits an act so heinous must pay his debt, in prison, according to the law. You know that if any Italian woman was beaten and raped by her husband, the partner and sometimes even by his father, would denounce the violence, prisons would be full of italian men. You've never seen 'Amore Criminale'? It is a great program that speaks about the subject, taking the cue from the most egregious cases, look for it on 'Raiplay'."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims are at home in France."}
{"HS":"According to a recent OFSTED report, a school in Birmingham is still segregating girls and boys, despite a Hight Court ruling in 2017 that this is unlawful.","CN":"Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's \/ 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements."}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"Are you saying that you want to fight against women, children and men who are fleeing their country, leaving everything they have in the hope of a better life?"}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"God forgive them, because they don't know what they say. But it is a sign of a profound historical, cultural and human ignorance."}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Does it really matter how Easter Eggs are labelled? I do not think this matter is really important. Calling them in another fashion does not change our culture."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"So that will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, Brexit. I did not know these were all down to Muslims! Wow!"}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is an incitement to hatred against a religion and a group of people."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is a common misconception. A lot of veiled women have an active life."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"The modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance."}
{"HS":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","CN":"Hatred and xenophobia must be fought, nothing else."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire."}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"My optician seems like a nice fellow, so I wonder why you think he is likely to kick off at a moment's notice."}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"Imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise groups of people."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Choice."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up."}

{"HS":"We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.","CN":"You talk as if inter-religious dialogue did not exist! There are minds, philosophers, feminist movements by Islamic groups who oppose terror. Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source.

{"HS":"People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it.","CN":"I noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. Actually, Muslims are kind and sincere. However, people usually can access only negative events and issues about Islam and do not consider good news meaningful.

{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It depends on which glasses you are looking at."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"I think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities Islam shares with Christianity. It teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Almost all Muslims live in peace with other religions."}
{"HS":"Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion.

{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"And why, I'm fine where I am."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from Islamic countries? While we're at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs.

{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace."}
{"HS":"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.","CN":"The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but if someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is very similar to Christianity, and as such it is not exempt from extremists strains, for example, as the anger of the other side of the Channel."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"The media is selective in the rape stories it shows. Muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines.

{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many Muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating Islam: https:\/\/5pillarsuk.com\/2019\/01\/03\/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester\/."}
{"HS":"Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.","CN":"No it isn't? Diversity is a strength."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"What do you mean by an Islamic area? Why do not we take a look at Dubai, an Islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I believe that many Arabs were instead damaged in the history by Europeans that they would have sent back to their homeland on rafts and dinghies."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"We Italians would never want to be generalized with the crimes committed by our fellow mobsters. Why should we do the same with foreign citizens or of other religions?"}

{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"The vast majority of Global Terrorism is about politics and land not faith. One fact you do not seem to want to deal with."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"The Koran is a book similar to the Bible, written in Arabic. No one wants to kill their own brothers of faith."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes. Criminals are not all of a certain race or religion, but one race and religion produces criminals.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"On a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 Muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror."}
{"HS":"\"islamophobia\" is a way to take away our freedom of expression.","CN":"Freedom of expression is defined by the French laws."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit."}
{"HS":"Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously.","CN":"So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong."}
{"HS":"Muslims steal our work.","CN":"Muslims are hired by employers. How can they steal jobs?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"If this would be the case then no Christian, Jew or pagan could have lived in Muslim land during or after the Prophet's time."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I am not aware that the Arab citizens (which by the way are also Christians) arrive in our country to control and impose their laws: many practice their religion in full compliance with those of others."}

{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"This is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-Muslims would you?"}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"How can you claim that? I invite you to do research about the Islamic religion. You will find that it has many features in common with our religion and that professes peace and dialogue and not violence."}

{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is a crime punishable by law."}
{"HS":"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.","CN":"I've never heard such a claim."}
{"HS":"I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.","CN":"Why would it? Why such hatred towards an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?"}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Hate really? Even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the Manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. See where I am going?"}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"That is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too."}
{"HS":"What have Muslims ever done for us?","CN":"Perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? You are welcome."}
{"HS":"A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.)","CN":"Any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. If you have faith I am shocked that you would question it."}
{"HS":"Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology.","CN":"Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense?"}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"Evidence?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us?"}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Muslims and others were invited into the UK after they fought and died in the second world protecting the UK because we needed help to rebuild the UK and they still do a great job keeping the NHS, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"In France the majority of citizens are against the veil or any other religious sign. This reality must be admitted."}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place."}
{"HS":"We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.","CN":"Where is your evidence for this? This is simply not true."}
{"HS":"The moderate Islam does not exist, Islam is Islam.","CN":"This is true, in fact, Islam is not an extreme religion, is an Abrahamic religion as Christianity and Judaism. But there is also religious fanaticism that distorts religion and makes it a tool of manipulation."}

{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Every religion can become fanaticism if it is radicalized but does not transform the entire original religion into fanaticism."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Muslims are people who believe in Islam, they follow their religion and do not impose anything on anyone. Perhaps you refer to ISIS."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all scum.","CN":"Type imam Boussena and we'll see who the scum is."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"These words remind us of a sad time in history."}

Why am I not surprised?"}
{"HS":"It is curious that almost all easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. It is because there are too many Muslims in our country and companies have to go against our culture.","CN":"Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion."}

{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one."}
{"HS":"Just visited the swimming baths with my little lad, 'Muslims Only' Session, couldn't get in. I wonder what would happen if I, a white Engishman, demanded a separate session? Its just Islamic appeasement!","CN":"Men Only' sessions are Friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. So what is this, 'Patriarchal Appeasement'?"}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"The fanatics represent only a small part of the Muslim population. If you do some research, you will notice that Islam preaches peace. So, why commit violence on innocent people?"}
{"HS":"We must eliminate this cult of hate and its supporters. Their literature is all about genocide and hate. Wake up Britain!","CN":"Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"There are also many Italian Muslims why we stop them from practising their beliefs? Why do we give this opportunity only to Catholics? Why do mosques bother you? And then I assure you that the number of mosques is negligible compared to the number of Catholic churches."}
{"HS":"The purpose of Islam is to take control of our country: they are trying to have the support of our government and when they will have it they are going to establish sharia and dominate our country.","CN":"Aren't having a place of worship, building a community and maintaining your legal rights fundamental to how most societies are organised?"}
{"HS":"These Islamists only think about stealing.","CN":"The thieves haven't a single country. You should know that!"}

{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Islam is a religion of love, the fundamentalism of jihad is not Islamism."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is just a demonstration of one's faith."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"The only ones in favour of Brexit are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I eat as usual and I get the usual flu, and you?"}
{"HS":"We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"How did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? I personally know many Muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. They also invite me for dinners."}
{"HS":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","CN":"Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?"}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"People run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. They run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. Pushing them back into their disasters is not humane."}
{"HS":"There are bands of muslim rapists everywhere in telford, rotherham, rochdale, oxford, newcastle etc. It is awful!","CN":"Do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by Muslims? What do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate?"}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. If you want to help make an impact, let's start by addressing the problem, not."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"Sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"How about all those non-Muslim school shooters? Is mass murder not terrorism if a non-Muslim does it?"}
{"HS":"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!","CN":"I agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or Governments."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other."}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"So how come I met so many intelligent and smart Muslim women then? I think you should not be so quick to judge."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"You maintain the concept of the \"clash of civilizations\" in order to frighten people."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I do not understand the meaning of your words."}
{"HS":"Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate.","CN":"Actually 26% of British doctors who are Asian or British\/Asian are helping to fight cancer."}
{"HS":"Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","CN":"Why have we built Churches all over the world? How many holy buildings have we demolished over history? This is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone?"}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Let's have a crusade. Except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder?"}
{"HS":"A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.).","CN":"Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Honestly, this kind of comment does not even deserve an answer."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"You sound a bit paranoid mate, I do not think Muslims feel the same way."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!"}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"All forms of phobia can be cured, I offer you a cure with Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Islam is not a religion of hate; terrorism has different roots."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is political for those who feel attacked by this piece of cloth on one's head."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Uninhibited Islamophobia."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"These are outdated clich\ufffd\ufffds."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"1.5 billion terrorists."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Islam is a non-racist religion where everyone is respected regardless of their origin and religion."}
{"HS":"British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will.","CN":"Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years."}
{"HS":"A woman who accepts to live hidden under a veil and gets beaten by her man does not deserve to live in a civilized country like Italy.","CN":"How can you believe that there is someone who agrees to be beaten? We should focus on how to help these women whether they are veiled or not, whether they are Italian or not!"}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"This is a poor\/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. Perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Many work, but you deny it."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"I'm not answering that question, because whoever asks it seeks to provoke."}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"No, Islam is a religion with a history like any other. Thank you."}
{"HS":"We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?"}
{"HS":"The purpose of Islam is to take control of our country: they are trying to have the support of our government and when they will have it they are going to establish sharia and dominate our country.","CN":"If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start a new life in a completely new place?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Good evening, in what sense control at our home? Creating a party and presenting at the election? With a coup? Where do I find information about it?"}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Islam means Peace."}
{"HS":"Muslims are contaminating our world.","CN":"Hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","CN":"The only thing that is ENOUGH is this discriminatory hate speech."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Why they all end in -ist?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Don't mix up politics and faith. No faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"I am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. Find out what is really going on #InquiryCSA #Truthproject."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Better a smart bomb. Oh, no. That threatens to hit you."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Too much imagination."}
{"HS":"Islam is barbaric.","CN":"Islam is a religion that respects all religions."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is mostly a media debate."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"There is a Muslim country ?? Either I'm noob in geography or there is a problem with your proposition."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"If I want to make a trip to an Arab country I'm not asked to make any vaccine because there aren't different diseases from ours."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Then we would be left with angry people like you. Doesn't seem to be the best plan."}
{"HS":"Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.","CN":"Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Except all of those which live and add to Western Societies."}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Long live the Republic and long live France! Proud to be French Muslim."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"I'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judged by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Personally around me, all the women I know who wear the veil, do in their soul and conscience. And you, have you taken the time to discuss respectfully, without preconceptions, with a woman who wears a veil?"}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam."}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I am sure that you see one, but this does not mean that it exists."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Islam is a religion not a political party. The veil is a cloth not a symbol."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Oh la la I don't understand much of \"ISTS\" anymore."}
{"HS":"Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.","CN":"Where did you get these statistics?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"So it is no longer a problem for you!"}
{"HS":"I've been into Muslim shops in areas of Birmingham and they have refused to serve me. I've even seen signs saying 'No Whites After 8pm'.","CN":"Judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This is an incitement to hatred and stigmatizes some French citizens."}
{"HS":"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?","CN":"A simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence)."}
{"HS":"It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up!","CN":"Do you know that much about Muslim culture? Dominating and destroying is not about them. You should first talk to experts in religion and then make up your opinion. Do not repeat stereotypes!"}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Whilst a small number of Muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the Muslim anti-extremism march in Cologne)"}
{"HS":"Their sacred books command to kill the infidels.","CN":"No, the Qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. Seriously, check your facts."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue."}
{"HS":"And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.","CN":"Why shouldn't we welcome people fleeing from suffering? Italy is a free country and is a right of every man to get political asylum."}
{"HS":"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.","CN":"With all the anti Islamic rhetoric floating around, do you think they have chosen that faith because it's easy?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Unfortunately, no nation is free from individual cases of madness, yet we are all human beings."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Muslims contribute much to Europe and have done since the 19th Century."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Of all the mass shootings that took place in the US in 2018, all were committed by white men. Were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says?"}
{"HS":"Our country is fighting a war against Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Why constantly stigmatize these harmless women (and discreet) that are very active in the social fabric of our cities and neighborhoods."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"You are the one who lacks tolerance towards a person who does not think like you."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"If you think that after harassing the woman she will become faulted, it is you who does not understand the respect for freedom of conscience."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"The percentage of Muslims in Italy is around 3%, which is very low. Even if it would be true that they are culturally backward (and often it is not true), a reduced number can hardly change the cultural base of a population."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'.","CN":"Source check?"}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?"}
{"HS":"We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims.","CN":"Show me evidence of this?"}
{"HS":"Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams!","CN":"Dear friend, do not you think anti-Muslim is another version of anti-Semitic? I suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it to save our NHS, run the trains and post office. None of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still need them."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"If you can give me the definition of all the words you use, I may listen to your arguments, if you have any."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Similarly, your negative attitude may be considered violent by others."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"The majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"What country are you talking about? Where do you want to deport them? In Germany? Or maybe in Drancy? To read to you."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"False Islam never rejected anyone, Islam is not only made for Maghreb, Arab, etc. The Muslim religion is for the world."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Maybe you have too little trust in the society in which you live. Close contact with different cultures does not necessarily undergo conditioning."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"This is false, the majority of Muslims coexist peacefully with non-Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"All the words end in ist, actually."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Except for Muslims, both Jesus and Easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with Easter."}
{"HS":"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children.","CN":"This is a sad matter, but not all Muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are Muslims."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Were you threatened with death as a Christian?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"It is the media that focuses on this."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"Apart from all those who use violence\/terrorism who are not Muslim?"}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"And tell me, how long did you spend studying the Quran? How long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with Muslims and their faith to understand them and Islam? How is it that you happen to know what Islam truly is?"}
{"HS":"Islam hates Christians and Jews.","CN":"Muslims have ruled over the Arab lands during the last 14 centuries. Yet today, the statistics tell us that 14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians (for generations), witnesses that Islam has not been answered by the sword. The Muslims ruled India for about a millennium. Today, more than 80% of Indians are not Muslims, witness that Islam was not imposed by the sword. The most populated areas Muslims are the east coast of Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, while no Muslim military force has gone into these areas, which were conquered only by the intellectual sword."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"How can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Secular values? On the contrary."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a peaceful religion and does not produce the best of men. It denounces women and encourages crimes. Criminals are not all of a certain race or religion, but one race and religion produces criminals.","CN":"This religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! The proportion of criminals is present in every society."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Evidence for this please?"}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"All Muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the Qu'ran."}
{"HS":"Muslims are anti-semitic.","CN":"Known anti-semitic acts in history were committed by non-Muslim Europeans."}
{"HS":"Our country is fighting a war against Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"Says who?"}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"I would like to point out that Islam and Isis are different. Islam is a peaceful religion, while Isis is a military and terrorist organization that supports Islamic fundamentalism."}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"Hi, I think that even in a delicate time like this it is important not to confuse those who commit acts of violence and the religion itself, which in its instructions does not permit such acts."}
