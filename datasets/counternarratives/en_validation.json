{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Another rapist from England. We should ..."}
{"HS":"They come to submit to us. This is the ideological project that Islam has always pursued .","CN":"A person living in conditions of deep social problems and emigrating to another country exports its tradition and religion, and wants to maintain them, exactly as the host country wants to maintain its own. This does not mean submission, it means coexistence, exchange, mutual enrichment."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"I do not think anyone must adapt to the culture of anyone. Rather, I think that everyone should have the right to live as they prefer and profess their faith freely, as long as they respect the life and religions of people."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Your statistics are not right, where did you get them? Why skew the stats to focus on Muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"True, nothing except 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through Muslim-owned firms in London alone."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"We live in a laic state, it is right that the crucifix is"}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"Italy is a laic state and being a place of education for children should be an occasion of comparison between cultures, beyond these controversies."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Try to change the word 'Muslim', it is repeated twice and it isn't so nice."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"Fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. Need I go on?"}

{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"British Muslims contribute 31 billion to the UK economy and you'd call that a threat?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Islam isn't incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. How many Muslims have you met that were rapists\/murderers\/had slaves?"}
{"HS":"Islam is irrational and incompatible with science.","CN":"Much like your statement then."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Why is a piece of cloth aggressive?"}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace. People using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles."}
{"HS":"Muslims force their child to fast during Ramadan.","CN":"This is wrong, they do it for themselves because they know the benefit of it."}
{"HS":"Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!","CN":"Do you have any evidence that Islam is being forced fed? I did not think so."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Terrorists are a very small part of Islam. Most Muslims fear terrorism as Christians."}
{"HS":"Their Prophet was a paedophile.","CN":"[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting CSE with article link]"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"We deplore the attacks and the resulting terror. We all deplore all violence! We are all aware of the confusion between Muslims and terrorists."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences."}

{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You mix together definitions and you use words that have no meanings, I can invite you to talk about it to have a precise definition."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Don't you like the color?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"This is not its goal. My veil is a piece of clothing that is part of me."}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"Evidence for this? All crime and hatred is wrong."}
{"HS":"Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.","CN":"Actually the Quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like Christianity its only God \/Allah that should judge."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Muslims are instead victims of a system that harasses them."}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. Migrants in the UK have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"It is wrong. And the texts prove it."}
{"HS":"Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem!","CN":"Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb.","CN":"Not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Look, the only disease that really is eradicated worldwide is smallpox, the others have not been eradicated."}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"Dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"How can a fabric be aggressive?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims contribute much to the UK, through their hard work and charitable activities."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They are free to do so."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Thereis a forgiving and an uncompromising Islam, just like Christianity or Judaism."}
{"HS":"How can we fight anti-Semitism when city ghettos of Birmingham, Bradford, etc. Are full of anti-Semitic Pakistani muslims? Labour is lost to the mix of Radical Islam\/middle class.","CN":"Dear friend, do not you think anti-Muslim is another version of anti-Semitic? I suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"All people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any Western society."}
{"HS":"Has our political elite forgotten that we were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.","CN":"I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?"}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"No one has ever been forced to convert to Islam. That would be known."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Yeah. And the many who die because of illegal hiring or racial hatred or fatigue?"}
{"HS":"All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything.","CN":"If they were violent they would have been punished too. Why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"You cannot generalize the actions of a few (criminals) with the behavior of the majority, which lives with us peacefully."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"This question should not even be imagined and lived together, what should we do with it?"}
{"HS":"I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam.","CN":"Never mind a bit of praying in public, how do we stop the Salvation Army waking us up on a Sunday with 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. A working man deserves a lie-in!"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"There are even many great business leaders and graduates, to name a few (if you are interested, of course)."}
{"HS":"Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult.","CN":"Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Those who terrorize do not respect any foundation of Islam."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"I invite you to see a shrink."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"The Muslim Council of Britain agrees that FGM is against Islamic teachings. Muslims disagree with FGM. Stop spreading negative stereotypes!"}
{"HS":"Our country is fighting a war against Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"You sound a bit paranoid mate, I do not think Muslims feel the same way."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Thinking to castrate people for their religious beliefs and not for their individual responsibilities seems the product of a really retrograde mentality. Certainly not typical of the advanced West."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Italy is our home and of all those who seek to escape death and misery, as well as the law, common sense and civil charity want."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Christians have set up crusades under the excuse of 'exterminating the infidels', we never heard about Muslims doing something like this."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy\/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest checking your sources?"}
{"HS":"Great Britain is not Great anymore, it is a shadow of its former self because of the cancer which is an islamic invasion.","CN":"If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"No one can force another person to adhere to a religion."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"Hi, I understand that the perception of the phenomenon is sometimes amplified by some media, but the number of Muslims in Italy is even less than 5%."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Muslim people I know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in Islam. They talk to their children about that. Thus, they indeed counteract such cases."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is Muslims who want to prevent blasphemy.","CN":"\"islamophobia\" is a crime."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Not at all, it is about knowing how to live and respect each religion."}
{"HS":"A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.","CN":"I cannot believe it! Looks like another scammy news which is actually not true."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen."}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"What does Islamization mean?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Your problem is intolerance, not the veil."}
{"HS":"There are bands of muslim rapists everywhere in telford, rotherham, rochdale, oxford, newcastle etc. It is awful!","CN":"Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"To dress a little bit more is normal if you are religious, I don't see the link with politics."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Did you know that the only terrorist attacks in Italy were made by Italians?"}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"So what about other religious books? They do not belong to our century either?"}
{"HS":"Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again.","CN":"How can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"But are we really still behind these bar's stereotypes ?"}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"If they were violent they would have been punished too. Why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty?"}
{"HS":"Islamics want to impose the burqa to our women as they do with theirs.","CN":"From what can you say that there is this desire from Muslims?"}
{"HS":"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?","CN":"Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https:\/\/ind.pn\/2GHjGn7."}

{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"These statements stigmatize some citizens."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Tolerance of others' religions must be mutual. You cannot convict a person based on his faith."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"No one wants to impose the removal of the crucifix in the classroom. It would be nice that at school everyone would be free to believe what they want and children could share the beauty of having different cultures."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"Did history teach you nothing? How can you say this about an entire group of people?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?"}
{"HS":"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen.","CN":"London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about?"}
{"HS":"I think islam is staining the humanity.","CN":"Without Islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have Maths, Science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"I personally have never met a Muslim who tried to evangelize me. Everyone is free to dress as they like and has the right to have a place to practice their religion. This does not question the freedom of us Italians to maintain our culture."}
{"HS":"Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you!","CN":"So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"I do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of Western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. Are you sure it is not Western society's intolerance that is the problem?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"That's not true. All the women I work with are veiled and working."}
{"HS":"Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why it is tolerating these despicable people.","CN":"Why have we built Churches all over the world? How many holy buildings have we demolished over history? This is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone?"}
{"HS":"If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques?","CN":"Surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! Read on. Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahor, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Karachi."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"It seems to me a fear not supported by any data."}
{"HS":"If they love Sharia law so much, why do not they go off and live in a Muslim country?","CN":"If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?"}
{"HS":"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy.","CN":"Sweeping statement about an entire faith."}
{"HS":"Muslims prevent girls from wearing skirts.","CN":"The Islam teaches modesty."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"Always the same words against foreigners."}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Yeah, because here in Italy no one has ever beat his wife ."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? Call me sceptical."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by Muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil \/ scarf is private, politics is public."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam also advocates freedom, equality and fraternity. This is visible in many verses and prophetic words."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I noticed that this comment contains so much hatred. Can you please tell me where it comes from?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The Koran condemns violence on women: who does it violate religious norms. Those who abuse women, Italians or foreigners, Christians or Muslims, respect neither the law nor the religion."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"No, NOT ME! Seriously, I have not done anything and most of the people who are 'terrorists' are not Muslims! More seriously, there are studies that say that! Check it out!"}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"It is not the veil that subjects veiled women but tweets like these."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"In Italy Muslims are one million and three hundred thousand: it seems logical that they have places in which to pray."}
{"HS":"It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up!","CN":"Dominating and destroying all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"It seems normal fo every republic to introduce a law against Islam out of nowhere."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"I think many people would disagree. I certainly want all our Muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here."}
{"HS":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","CN":"Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?"}
{"HS":"Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work.","CN":"This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"No, studies show that most terrorists are not Muslims (separatists for example)."}
{"HS":"Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.","CN":"Muslim people I know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in Islam. They talk to their children about that. Thus, they indeed counteract such cases."}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Christians also practise FGM. It is not a uniquely Muslim problem."}
{"HS":"Islam and peace cannot coexist!","CN":"According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank which has produced the Global Peace index for the past 10 years, only Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Qatar, Switzerland, Uruguay and Vietnam are free from conflict. Qatar has a sizable number of followers of Islam apparently."}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"Eradicating these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"Look, I struggle to understand your position. I only read words of hatred and rejection of the other, of the different? Wouldn't it be better to put all human beings in the same boat?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Pure Amalgams."}
{"HS":"Muslims are weak-minded.","CN":"Islam is a religion that calls for reasoning."}
{"HS":"It is one law for Muslims and another law for us.","CN":"It is quite literally not."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"If by problem you mean that Muslims are investing a public space that was forbidden to them until a few decades ago, it is not society that has a Muslim problem, it is you who have a hate problem."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Terms used to legitimize dictatorial regimes and to justify repression and massacres of peoples as well as shot status as in Egypt."}
{"HS":"Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting!","CN":"This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics show that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Why does their background matter?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"I am not aware that Muslims (which is different from the Arabs since some are Christians) seek to impose their rules on us."}
{"HS":"You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.","CN":"Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims are not foreigners."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Christians are all fundamentalist terrorists in the pay of the Iraqi people."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Aren't you trying to make a statement of intent?"}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"My veil is personal and reflects my personal convictions."}
{"HS":"I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.","CN":"There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration."}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"The quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. Jihadists do not represent the islamic faith."}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"Animals for what reason?"}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"Millions of Muslims are Europeans."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Actually, Muslims have varied and beneficial business relations with the West, I do not think they want to kill us."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I agree with you when I'm in Marrakesh, too French! Paranoia is settling in!"}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"A very small percentage of Muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. Cant generalize it to Muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of Islam."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Violence and terrorism are serious problems, but only who commits them are responsible, not all of them: Italians are not all responsible for the crimes of the Mafia or Camorra."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"It is a lack of awareness of Muslim women."}
{"HS":"They impose on us their culture.","CN":"I think as long as they do not force us to eliminate churches and ham there is nothing to be alarmed about;)."}
{"HS":"Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail.","CN":"Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims participate in the development of the country."}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"It is quite a generalisation to say anyone from Pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. Nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"Can you elaborate your words because the problems you mention are surely economic social problems."}
{"HS":"Thousands of British girls are raped, enslaved or murdered by Muslims and other non-British immigrants. Woe to thee!","CN":"Evidence please? This is just hatred."}
{"HS":"This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and ideology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today.","CN":"You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?"}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Responding to violence with violence is never the best answer. And history should teach us. Also, it would be good to not throw babies the bath water. Terrorism is not just a given geographic or ethnic belonging."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Good evening, the main victims of the terrorist attacks are the inhabitants of Arab countries. For the most part, then, they are victims, not terrorists."}
{"HS":"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists.","CN":"Do you have the statistics for domestic violence in Great Britain? This is even a huger problem in Great Britain! I'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything!"}
{"HS":"Muslims are the ones who invented the slave trade.","CN":"No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"If you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil, according to Muslim belief, is a religious prescription."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"And for other religions, what do we say?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Our religion has no nationality."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"The fault of a few cannot fall on all Muslims, also they are the ones to be the first victims of terrorism."}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"Do not you think it is unfair to blame an entire category of persons defined by you 'Arab' for the actions of a few? Crime and terrorism, unfortunately, have always existed and always have different colours and ethnic groups. There are Arab terrorists as Italian terrorists."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"Any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. Fortunately, the vast majority of Muslims see Islam as a religion of peace. There are people that interpret the Bible, the Torah, etc. As inciting hate too."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Violating of rights for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general."}
{"HS":"It is one law for Muslims and another law for us.","CN":"Example?"}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"If by appeasement you really mean keeping the NHS running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, it's mental."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"The only thing that is ENOUGH is this discriminatory hate speech."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Apart from the fact that they are not Arab but African or Asian, I do not see command attempts in our country. We are the ones going to their country to command."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life whatever their faith."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"And then they do what they want."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Do all illiterate nannies and housekeepers play politics? No, of course not, but this one doesn't bother us, they serve!"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"These words are to avoid debate."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"There is no compulsion in Islam, the use of the veil by the woman is a personal choice and of faith, it is not required by the family or by the husband."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"The Muslim religion does not plan to rape women."}
{"HS":"We breed pigs to feed muslims.","CN":"Why is it necessary to make this unreasonable action, when you can communicate and understand why are there certain elements of religion?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Muslims have no intention of returning to the Middle Ages: the integralists are a minority."}
{"HS":"Appeasement to Islam and Muslims is a mental illness. It is a fact.","CN":"It is called tolerance. It is a fact. Do try it!"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"You are really generalizing. Among many good people, there is certainly some criminal, but as always happens. Using terms such undignified only sharpens the hatred, I do not share your language."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"It is harmful to attack a calm minority who only wants one thing: to integrate into the society."}
{"HS":"Muslims have invaded our country.","CN":"Muslims live in peace with their religion."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"It seems to me that the shame of the Italian school is very different."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil \/ headscarf is a personal and free choice."}
{"HS":"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with.","CN":"Terrorists come in all religions and political views. People opposing Trump were sent letter bombs, the 'Troubles' saw Christian terrorists on both sides of the border. Let's challenge all terrorism."}
{"HS":"Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.","CN":"Do you think maybe the media paints this picture of Islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? Climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind."}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is a right. Fighting Islam is a duty.","CN":"Islamophobia is a crime."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Others are well subject to idiocy."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on.","CN":"What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blamed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?"}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all violent.","CN":"Muslims are not violent, if some people get out of hand, it does not particularly mean that all Muslims are violent."}
{"HS":"I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology.","CN":"Surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we follow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture?"}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"It does not seem to me that there are so many mosques in our cities. Could you provide me some data about their number?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Assuming that no Arab religion, Italian, Spanish, Australian, etc. Exist. And then all religions have their own share of witness and spread of the word. Especially Jehovah's Witnesses and Christians, but I've never heard of Muslims if you are referring to them, who sought to impose their religion even with force."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Islam is a religion, and as with all religions, there may be episodes of fundamentalism (Christian history is full of them). This should not lead us to generalize."}
{"HS":"These Bedouins treat women like beasts and cut their throat if they do not follow their barbarian dictates.","CN":"Honestly, I see around many more Muslim women without burqa or veil than women dressed like Europeans."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are all mothers at home.","CN":"Wrong. Useless."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Castration according to belonging to a specific religion is something inhuman, being a Muslim does not mean being rapists."}
{"HS":"Islam is a non-peaceful religion that professes violence.","CN":"There aren't monotheistic religions that profess violence. Those who practice violence are to be considered extremist regardless of the religion to which he belongs."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"If they choose so, you can not deny them, human rights guarantee the freedom of worship."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"That's the phrases BFM and the FN loves to feed more hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"It's a horrendous fact, but to generalize and direct the hatred on a single community is infamous. The problem of violence against women, and unfortunately, these hideous crimes are mostly committed by Italians, at home."}
{"HS":"Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.","CN":"Pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, including Robert De Niro, this scapegoating of Muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"Talking of 'Islamic invasion' assumes that all the people who come are Muslim, well it isn't like that! Africa is not Islam."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Come to my college and you won't be disappointed."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Evidence?"}
{"HS":"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist.","CN":"As is every far right armchair activist."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"This may disappoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion."}
{"HS":"Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work.","CN":"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen\/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. That I've encountered must be part of that 1% then?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"What diseases are you talking about? And how could people who believe in a religion lead to starvation? It would be like saying that Catholics will reduce us to thirst or cold."}
{"HS":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","CN":"Religions also promote arts, sciences, and help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair."}
{"HS":"They make us think that islam is a religion to diffuse their doctrine in our tolerant culture. Enough is enough!","CN":"Islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Among the Muslims, as among Christians, there are persons that are very conservative and others that are very open and share the values"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Christian veil is however not connected with the policy as it is the same motivation."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"And if all Muslims were to leave, women and girls would still be harmed - most of it comes from family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no NHS or train service."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is you, who attack me, my veil stays on my head and does not do anything."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What are these values?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Muslims do have a place in Europe's multicultural society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."}
{"HS":"I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you!","CN":"I do not know what Muslims have done to you, but I know many beautiful and kind persons among them. So it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place \/ society?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"They do what they want, and you are saying lies and I could drag you to court for defamation."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is by definition the universal value."}
{"HS":"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.","CN":"This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?"}
{"HS":"They want to impose the veil on all of us.","CN":"The vast majority of Muslim women living in Europe wear the veil voluntarily, respecting the religious beliefs of Islam, no one imposes it to them! There is no intention to convert to Islam Italian women."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Italy is a secular country. Everyone has the right to profess their religion. Islam isn't a retrograde religion, please do some research. We welcome them in our country because they really need help."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Get out of your cave."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"How can you say a person is a potential terrorist?"}
{"HS":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","CN":"When was the last time you read any holy book? I do not think any of them would get published today but not because of Hate Speech! Without faith they're just not great reads!"}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"How is that my freedom to dress myself as I understand an aggression?"}
{"HS":"(responding to a terrorist attack :) still a Buddhist, and they want us to believe that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.","CN":"I dissociate myself from this act as a Muslim."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"#islamophobia. The freedom to wear the veil is a fundamental human rights. It does not interfere with your freedom."}
{"HS":"To solve all our problems it is enough to burn down mosques and the Koran.","CN":"What type of problems will this solve?"}
{"HS":"Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and\/or Ebola.","CN":"Are you talking about the Muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses?"}
{"HS":"They impose on us their culture.","CN":"Living together starting from different roots and the cultural precondition is possible and it will be increasingly frequent and daily, but not easy, we must learn both us and them."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"The only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that are ignorant about what they truly mean."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Can a Muslim wear that many hats? What does he do the rest of his free time? These Muslims must hold polytechnic degrees!"}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"Well if we are talking about LGBT rights and misogyny, the Bible does not exactly have the best track record. But we've learnt to focus on positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics."}
{"HS":"Die islamic!","CN":"I suggest you to do a research about Islam. You will notice that it is a religion that has a lot in common with ours. It is monotheistic and has many prophets who also belong to Christianity."}
{"HS":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people.","CN":"Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The thing that bothers you is that Muslims no longer raze the walls and refuse to hide anymore."}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"I can suggest you a book: 'French elite and construction of the Muslim problem' by Julien Beaug\ufffd\ufffd and Abdellali Hajjat."}
{"HS":"Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.","CN":"You are not asked to love Muslim women, but to respect them and not to discriminate against them. Thank you."}
{"HS":"France is a secular country, the practice of Islam should be banned.","CN":"Secularism is the neutrality of the state towards all religions on an equal footing."}
{"HS":"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!","CN":"Could you give me a source at the base of such a strong statement? Because to me it does not appear that there is this trend going on."}
{"HS":"Muslims must integrate or leave France!","CN":"It is rather that France has integrated Muslims from the Mediterranean."}
{"HS":"We cannot trust the Muslims, they are all swindlers.","CN":"Is your goal to break national harmony? You will not succeed."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"I do not know the definition of political Islam and I wear the scarf."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"It is a hoax. Do not be persuaded by this crap, all the holy books, including the Bible, have very violent passages. The vast majority of believers want to live in peace, not be swayed by a few violent."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"The construction of mosques can also facilitate the control of the state in any possible situation of radicalization."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The Islamic veil falls within the religious and is not intended to offend people."}
{"HS":"Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams!","CN":"Sociological research shows that Western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. Thus, we cannot say that Muslims prevent the white people from getting the position."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Really? Cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"What is your hatred of Muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"More tolerant than us."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"You have to make the difference between choosing and locking them up."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Could you provide us with supporting evidence (questionnaires and methodologies used.)? Sources?"}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Hi, in Italy freedom of religion is a fundamental principle: no one has to adapt to a culture, but you must have the right to profess your faith in full freedom and respect for each other I think."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"This statement that you express in this comment seems wrong. Could you send me the source where you have obtained it?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"I would probably be far away if that were true."}
{"HS":"Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?","CN":"Our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. Does it mean that the government is submitting to them? To me it means being humane! You should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not."}
{"HS":"A woman who accepts to live hidden under a veil and gets beaten by her man does not deserve to live in a civilized country like Italy.","CN":"No woman agrees to be beaten, be unable to break free from a state of violence and submission does not mean wanting to be in it. The veil if chosen freely should not be a problem for those who simply do not choose it."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Do you know that you are using a lot of things in your everyday life that Muslims invented, right?"}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Why? Will you be richer or happier?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"I am Muslim and none of these adjectives represents me, so, no."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"It does not appear to me, actually."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"The fundamentalists of all religions, want to kill all those who do not believe in their god."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Even if I don't necessarily like certain behaviours, I don't consider it a personal aggression, a little TOLERANCE won't hurt you."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?"}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Fake news and fearmongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night?"}
{"HS":"They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.","CN":"Hello, actually the number of Muslims in Italy amounts to just under 5% of the total population: do you believe that it is possible to talk about replacing?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Incitement to hatred."}
{"HS":"99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work.","CN":"So all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? I do not think so!"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"I don't know any women who are veiled out of obligation."}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"This speech is in contradiction with secularism, some European communities have adopted Islam for centuries, while other Christian communities have maintained their religion in the so-called Muslim countries."}
{"HS":"Muslims in China were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol during the recent Chinese New Year celebration - At least China is doing it right!!","CN":"You really want to support the role of the State in prescribing what people should eat or drink?"}
{"HS":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","CN":"The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor."}
{"HS":"Islamic are criminals: they rape, enslave and murder people. Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. It is impossible to take it out of our life!"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"Islam is a religion of peace, love and brotherhood. It has never intended to kill or brutalize people."}
{"HS":"We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.","CN":"Islam is not isis! Muslims themselves, such as homosexuals, suffer persecution and run away from the oppressors!"}
{"HS":"Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated.","CN":"Let's do the Timewarp again! Let's not re-run the Crusades. It did not end well last time."}
{"HS":"Our country is fighting a war against Islam for a thousand years.","CN":"To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations."}
{"HS":"They want to conquer the world, we have to defend Italy by blowing them up before they blow us up.","CN":"But who? It seems to me that, like many others, they simply want to express their faith freely."}
{"HS":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","CN":"Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes."}
{"HS":"People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims.","CN":"Except all of those which live and add to Western Societies."}
{"HS":"Only a few people were punished for yesterday's violations instead of all them violent Muslims, and if the government does not deport these criminals, then the common people will take care of them.","CN":"In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"I want them here?"}
{"HS":"Islam does not belong to Europe.","CN":"Europe is full of all religions and ethnic groups."}
{"HS":"If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed.","CN":"How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Too late!"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"History teaches that Christians wanted to impose their religion at the home of others."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"During the time of Prophet Mohamad, women were active participants in society."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity."}
{"HS":"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere.","CN":"Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority."}
{"HS":"The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.","CN":"The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is."}
{"HS":"All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here.","CN":"Deported to where? A majority of Muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The veil is a personal religious choice. What does it have to do with politics?"}
{"HS":"These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment!","CN":"Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!"}
{"HS":"The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","CN":"In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White."}
{"HS":"Labour party counts upon the votes of Britain Muslims, that is why they do not deal with disgusting antisemitism from their side! It is a question of math, that is all.","CN":"Do you know the numbers of the votes of Britain Muslims?"}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"You cannot discuss while generalizing a population, the cases should be analyzed individually."}
{"HS":"Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.","CN":"Why cannot we talk to each other? In this way, we introduce them to our culture and us to theirs. It seems like a good compromise."}
{"HS":"It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims.","CN":"No, it is not a fact because it is simply not true."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Muslims do not exist, nor does Buddhism or Christianity. Islam is a religion and not a country. Each country has its own citizens, and often not all citizens have the same religion."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"It is similar to saying that your haircut is an attack against humanity."}
{"HS":"Quite strange, the majority of Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs', I think this is because of the Muslims in our country, and the companies are betraying our culture.","CN":"Does it really matter how Easter Eggs are labelled? I do not think this matter is really important. Calling them in another fashion does not change our culture."}

{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"I send you my resume and you tell me what you think? Be careful, it is a little long!"}
{"HS":"It appears I cannot criticize islam for being a cult which encourages wars and takes over host nations by any means justified by their scriptures. Can I critisize them for being intolerant, biased, sexist and chauvinist?","CN":"Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"It is not correct to speak of Islamic invasion because according to the 'Pew research center' in Italy Islamists are 4.8% of the population."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"They did not choose not to work. They are prevented from working when they graduate, but there is no problem working with her veil when she is in the household."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"It is an Islamophobic clich\ufffd\ufffd."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Lie."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"In Italy the highest number of rapes is commited at home, from friends, partners or relatives."}
{"HS":"Islam is fanaticism. Muslims want to kill all who do not believe in their god.","CN":"Generalizing is very dangerous. Perhaps these are people who have a belief different from yours, but the integration and encounter between different cultures is essential nowadays."}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"If you had said 'the home counties' I might have given this tweet a like."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"That is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these diseases spread."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Religiously women should wear the veil or headscarf. This is a submission to the rules of Allah and not man."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"This sentence makes no sense."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Unhealthy political recovery."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"That's your opinion and it is far from being the truth."}
{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Nothing is achieved with violence. We must be able to dialogue and find a point of cohesion between the two religions. Fanaticism is not true Islam. The Muslims who arrive in Italy are the first to be persecuted by the real extremists."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Err, I think you have got this victim thing down quite well."}
{"HS":"I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.","CN":"The often ignored fact is that Muslims are some of the largest victims of ISIS and within the ISIS-controlled community itself."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"There are definitely (few) people who hate Christians. There are Christians who have killed and destroyed entire Muslim countries, raped their daughters and killed their wives."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"No, it is a need that can be shared, no Catholic faithful is competing with others to pray."}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"I think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"You know nothing about the religion or its practitioners."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?"}
{"HS":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","CN":"So 1.6 billion people could be terrorists?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"I've never seen a veiled woman that represents a political movement."}
{"HS":"Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there.","CN":"Shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the English language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised Europe' from the Islamic world?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Such statements jeopardize living together."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"And the cases of violence made by Italians? How do you explain them according to your logic? Do we also castrate them?"}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"In fact, Muslims have continued to help our society. For instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. Muslims also have condemned terrorism and ISIS in plentiful news medias around the world."}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"You see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in?"}
{"HS":"What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded.","CN":"The point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too."}
{"HS":"Islam is just a nasty stain on humanity.","CN":"Without Islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have Maths, Science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"If this is the case it is wrong."}
{"HS":"These islamic beasts rape their and our women, after all their religion allows it to them!","CN":"Hi, the Muslim religion does not admit in its instructions so atrocious acts. Those who act in this way go against their faith, I would never equate criminals with everyone else who practice their religion peacefully."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"And if all Muslims were to leave, women and girls would still be harmed - most of it comes from family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no NHS or train service."}
{"HS":"Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence.","CN":"How did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? I personally know many Muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. They also invite me for dinners."}
{"HS":"Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam.","CN":"I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'."}
{"HS":"Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'they want to eliminate us, we must be islamophobic'.","CN":"Source check?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Well, listen to someone like me who is in Master's research in Educational Sciences. I'm well locked up ?."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it to save our NHS, run the trains and post office. None of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still need them."}
{"HS":"Muslims, their texts as hate literature, and other manifestations of hate and genocide should be eradicated. We should have no tolerance towards this cult of hate! Imprison supporters of Islam, wake up Britain!","CN":"Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?"}
{"HS":"We are seeing more and more of a Muslim problem.","CN":"The stigma of a religion has never been a problem for us but rather a problem for you."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Amalgams that can kill."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"No, it is just a religious practice of personal choice."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"I do not understand this term."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Previously: 'Muslim women wear the veil because they are subjected' Now: 'The Islamic veil is the demonstration of a political Islam'. So Muslim women have no choice. Once again! They make the choice to support a political Islam! Find the mistake."}
{"HS":"Don't the Moslem's Holy books say 'kill infidels wherever they may be hiding'.","CN":"No, the Qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. Seriously, check your facts."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"After having built it?"}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there were no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?"}
{"HS":"Islamophobia is Muslims who want to prevent blasphemy.","CN":"Muslims do not want to ban blasphemy."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"If they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. So what is your problem?"}
{"HS":"Islam purpose is only the conquest.","CN":"Every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to Islam."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"Answer by the absurd: if they were all, why would they be the most numerous victims of terrorists?"}
{"HS":"These animals.","CN":"In this world we are all men, no one is an animal. Muslims are people like us and should be treated as such."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Religious terrorism exists in all religions and this remains an infinitely small minority."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say that about 1.6 billion people?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.","CN":"The Arabs are not all terrorists. The extremists represent only a small part of the total Muslim population. We should not generalize, but dialogue."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"But a lack of respect to whom?"}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Sending home people who came to our country to try to change their life for the better, running away from wars, despair and poverty, would be the same as sending you home if your house was unsafe after an earthquake or was on fire."}
{"HS":"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people.","CN":"Nah mate, they really don't."}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"A part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. Who identify as muslim?"}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Anyone who rape a woman in Italian territory should not be castrated, he will instead serve the sentence that our laws establish."}
{"HS":"Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK!","CN":"Bit of a generalisation, isn't it? If you cannot see that most Muslims contribute positively to the UK, you need to do a quick google search I think."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Secularism, the value of the republic, should be there to guarantee the rights of Muslims."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Can you define the policy for me?"}
{"HS":"Muslims must integrate or leave France!","CN":"Muslims are already integrated into France. They drive our buses, educate our children and build the nation."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"There are no correlations between migrants and diseases, the director of the health board 2 of Rome says this.

{"HS":"We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.","CN":"It's like saying all Italians corrupt! I suggest you read something about Ahmadiyya Islamic movement, which focuses on the benevolent messages of peace, universal brotherhood and submission to the will of God. In 2016 they gathered in 30 thousand to oakland farm to oppose Islam!"}
{"HS":"One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.","CN":"Does Jimmy Saville represent all British Christians? Of course not, punish the individual not the community."}
{"HS":"Islamists \/ Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.","CN":"From your spiel about 'Moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling."}
{"HS":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","CN":"Millions of muslims live in western nations."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"On what basis do you define this religion retrograde? Because it professes values"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Your speech is insidious and disgusting."}
{"HS":"(responding to a terrorist attack :) still a Buddhist, and they want us to believe that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.","CN":"The message of Islam is peace, but those who practice it have misunderstood the message."}
{"HS":"Islam will invade us: It is Islamization.","CN":"The fear of the unknown."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Our country allows us to live our religion."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"Positive news stories*."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Islam is a religion of tolerance and peace."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"Are you worried that Italians may have competitors? It seems that italian men get busy, femicide every 72 hours!"}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? Because I am struggling to figure this out."}
{"HS":"The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.","CN":"Christians and Muslims have always tried to spread their religion, but today they do not impose it by force. Also in the past, Muslims have done this, even if less often than Christians. Keep in mind that in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Islamics for almost 1400 years, there are still important Christian minorities today."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"I have no accountability. I was born in France, grew up in France, educated in France and working in France. So I'm French whether you like it or not."}
{"HS":"Ultimately, the Muslims want to either convert us or kill us.","CN":"Islam is a beautiful religion of peace, in complete harmony with the values of the republic: freedom, equality and brotherhood."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"I wish we continued to receive, we would have far fewer deaths in the sea; in any case, the Italian legislation does not provide any maintenance."}
{"HS":"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.","CN":"Competition is good for the free market, perhaps with more choice, we earn heaven."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"And the veil of Christian sister is not an aggression to you?"}
{"HS":"Islam teaches only hate! Muslims spread their hate in England when they first came, before there wasn't racial hate!","CN":"Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?"}
{"HS":"Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate.","CN":"A nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me."}
{"HS":"Islam oppresses and persecutes gay and women.","CN":"In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by its followers that matters."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Your reflection proves that learning is vital."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. Anyone else a fan of Monty Python?"}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"Look in England, Canada or African countries you would be surprised to see that they work when they are not prevented from doing so."}
{"HS":"Muslims: return to your country.","CN":"Our country is France! This is where we were born, this is where we grew up, this is where we pay our taxes and this is where we will die."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"So many lies and shortcuts."}
{"HS":"A woman who accepts to live hidden under a veil and gets beaten by her man does not deserve to live in a civilized country like Italy.","CN":"Italy unfortunately is full of unveiled women that are beaten by their men, where they should live?"}
{"HS":"Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away!","CN":"Why should someone who is working \/ studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries?"}
{"HS":"We need to eradicate these pests, stop their benefits, free housing, access to our National Health service and remove them ALL from the UK, it is the only language they will understand.","CN":"26% of all doctors working in the NHS are Asian or Asian British, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have privileges that we do not have.","CN":"In what way?"}
{"HS":"The only purpose of Islam is to dominate and destroy us! Being multicultural has nothing to do with it.","CN":"No it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples."}
{"HS":"We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence.","CN":"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it's better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes."}
{"HS":"According to a recent OFSTED report, a school in Birmingham is still segregating girls and boys, despite a Hight Court ruling in 2017 that this is unlawful.","CN":"The quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. Isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'Islamic issue'?"}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Boeri said that immigrants that work in Italy are those who support us and the pensions of our grandparents. We give them the most precarious jobs and a livelihood almost nonexistent, that comes from Europe, not from state coffers."}
{"HS":"Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'.","CN":"Is this true? Where is your source?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I don't know of any case of infectious diseases brought by migrants, from what source did you take this belief?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"I'm sorry if you have had such a dramatic experience, I assure you that living together may also be non-traumatic, and that in most cases it is."}
{"HS":"Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence.","CN":"This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?"}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Have you every interacted with a muslim?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"No religion encourages violence towards others. I do not think it is a muslim issue at all."}
{"HS":"Islam is a cult and not a religion. They rape children, enslave and murder people, attack our values, and there is nothing good about it. It is incompatible with our way of life.","CN":"The demonisation of the Muslim community is the real problem here. Comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not Islam."}
{"HS":"Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.","CN":"What have 'all' Pakistani people done to deserve deportation? Sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"It is a generality. Whether they are home or elsewhere, what does this change for you? Some work, others do not, like unveiled women. There is no connection between the two."}
{"HS":"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.","CN":"In most schools the crucifix is"}
{"HS":"Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.","CN":"The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not."}
{"HS":"Why must Islam invade every country? That is just totalitarian. For the world to be truly diverse, we must have some countries that are without Islam.","CN":"By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?"}
{"HS":"Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.","CN":"Well, when the pope who represents 1.2 billion catholics and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood,\" i know who i will believe. Stop just listening to the news you want to believe."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"No other ist."}
{"HS":"Islam hates women.","CN":"The Qur'an honors some women such as Mary (mother of Jesus) and the wife of Pharaoh."}
{"HS":"Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century.","CN":"Christian ideology is even more ancient than Islam, and Buddhism is even centuries older. Are you suggesting to ban all the religions? Or are you specifically picky about Islam?"}
{"HS":"Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women.","CN":"This religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! The proportion of criminals is present in every society."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"For a Muslim who believes or disbelieves whoever wants, Allah alone will decide between them and us. \"to me my religion, to you your religion\"."}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"Faith is not imposed."}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"There are 8.5 million Muslims in France. If they were terrorized, France has long been a bloodbath."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"Have you asked, at least once, to a veiled woman, if she was forced to wear a veil?"}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"1.8 billion Muslims in the world. So 1.8 billion terrorists."}
{"HS":"Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism.","CN":"This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Muslims cannot add any value to our culture.","CN":"I take it you have never eaten a curry then?"}
{"HS":"We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours?","CN":"So i guess you are talking about the Middle East? That place where Christianity originated from. Sure."}
{"HS":"The veiled women do not work. They are locked up at home.","CN":"If they do not work, it may be because the state forbids them to."}
{"HS":"Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people.","CN":"Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda."}
{"HS":"Repatriation of Muslims to any Islamic country is a necessity. Islamic culture is not compatible with our values.","CN":"I am no expert but I do not see Islam as a single, mono-culture any more than Christianity is. Surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"I urge you to do some research and you'll find that only a small part of the Italian population is of islamic faith."}
{"HS":"The veil is contrary to secularism.","CN":"Like the use of all the other religious symbols (cross or kippah for example), the use of the veil is guaranteed by secularism."}
{"HS":"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history.","CN":"Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"What are the incompatibilities? I do not see them."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"And the opposite? Because I'm looking at a history book of the third grade. And it is embarrassing for you."}
{"HS":"A real Islamic invasion is taking place.","CN":"Not true, Muslims are not invaders for definition, and Christianity is still the first religion in Italy."}
{"HS":"Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.","CN":"Are we still in the Crusades? I thought it was 2019 ."}
{"HS":"Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!","CN":"This is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith?"}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion incompatible with the values","CN":"Islam is compatible throughout the world except for dictatorial regimes, unjust authoritarian regimes, champions of decadence. Which is not the case of the republic as far as I know."}
{"HS":"Muslims should go home.","CN":"Muslims should live freely as everyone else."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate."}
{"HS":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","CN":"Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet."}
{"HS":"Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that.","CN":"Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping."}
{"HS":"Is this Afghanistan or Pakistan? You would never say this is an english town.#saville town (text accompanying video footage of people on their way to friday prayers etc. ).","CN":"At what point in history did England not have people from other places joining us? Vikings, Saxons, Romans. We integrate the best things and move forward."}
{"HS":"If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are.","CN":"What it really is is up for interpretation. Religions are practiced differently by different followers. Like any religion, some people follow it peacefully and some use it for their own means."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"I'm not surprised to hear it from someone who is obsessed with social networking."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Unfortunately, this proposal was taken up by the political class."}
{"HS":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","CN":"Muslims feed the homeless London, Cardiff, Birmingham (everywhere) BBC news; Muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google."}
{"HS":"I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you!","CN":"So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples."}
{"HS":"Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place.","CN":"The truth is the worldwide Muslims denounce ISIS and its violence. Plus, many Muslims are the victims of ISIS. According to <The Guardian>, 'Isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global Muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why Muslims from Syria and Iraq may want to migrate to countries like Australia.'."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"Judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"Deported to where? A majority of Muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been."}
{"HS":"We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country.","CN":"By 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here?"}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"Excuse me, why should we suffer from hunger because of Muslims? Can you tell me why, please?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What is political Islam? You have 2 hours ."}
{"HS":"Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola.","CN":"This person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it!"}
{"HS":"We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country.","CN":"No one is offended by people celebrating Christmas. Myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all fundamentalist Islamist Salafist terrorists.","CN":"What do you mean by Salafist Islamists? We must avoid being dumbfounded by the continuous news channels BFM."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause?"}
{"HS":"The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","CN":"Do you really think this? So how otherwise they can support themselves?"}
{"HS":"Veiled women are subjected and forced to wear the headscarf.","CN":"The veil is put to approach God and pray."}
{"HS":"Your veil is an attack against me.","CN":"Funny definition of aggression."}
{"HS":"We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.","CN":"Poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. Please enlighten me as to how banishing Islam would solve these problems?"}
{"HS":"Just visited the swimming baths with my little lad, 'Muslims Only' Session, couldn't get in. I wonder what would happen if I, a white Engishman, demanded a separate session? Its just Islamic appeasement!","CN":"After checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'Women Only', 'Men Only' and 1 hour a week for 'Muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about."}
{"HS":"These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.","CN":"I do not see how belonging to the Muslim religion can somehow bring damage to others or spread diseases."}
{"HS":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","CN":"Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism."}
{"HS":"Islam is a religion of war, we must all fight.","CN":"It does not disturb anything."}
{"HS":"Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.","CN":"In comparison to cases of violence in Italy made by foreigners, which are 15% of the total, Italians have the 80% at home and proudly the world record as sex tourists in poor countries. The arrogance of money does not exonerate them, that's double violence."}
{"HS":"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","CN":"Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful."}
{"HS":"The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.","CN":"The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims."}
{"HS":"In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm.","CN":"Please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred."}
{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"Do you have any statistics?"}
{"HS":"Islam is the religion of obscurantism.","CN":"Really? How do you explain that the prophet says that all extremism is not part of Islam? Islam is a religion of the middle class and a light for humanity."}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"What is an Islamic veil? Again, I need a context! Political Islam? What do you mean?"}
{"HS":"Muslims hate anyone who is not Muslim.","CN":"Respect for others is the basis of living together and Islam respects everyone."}
{"HS":"It is absurd to see how in 2018 there is a religion so conservative, and we let them disembark in mass in our country! Italy will always remain a Christian country!","CN":"Italy is a secular country."}
{"HS":"We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode!","CN":"Holocaust mk 2? Are you really that person?"}
{"HS":"The Islamic veil is the demonstration of political Islam.","CN":"The lives of Muslim citizens must not be taken hostage under the pretext of creating an ideological concept."}
{"HS":"Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate.","CN":"One of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. Maybe if you made Muslims feel more welcome, they would?"}
{"HS":"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.","CN":"They ask only to be able to practice their religion."}
{"HS":"In the swimming pool there are baths only for Muslims, I cannot enter. If I, a white men, asked for something like this nobody would allow me. Muslims can do anything they want.","CN":"After checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'Women Only', 'Men Only' and 1 hour a week for 'Muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about."}
{"HS":"We welcome them in our house, we support them and they kill us: they are beasts, not men.","CN":"Good evening, the number of murders falls every year, despite the growth (until 2016) in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy. How do you connect the two data?"}

{"HS":"People who criticize Islam and its traits in our country - rape gangs and terrorism - are being banned, but this will not end well. People are driven to the right - the only ones who can openly talk about it!","CN":"I think people are banned because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped.

{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children.

{"HS":"Muslims are all terrorists.","CN":"There are extremists in all religions. The essential thing is to remember that God does not want to kill him towards these brothers and sisters in humanity."}

Islam is more a worship than a religion and we do not have anything to share with them.","CN":"Pretending Islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere."}
{"HS":"Islam is not a religion, its just an excuse for retarded sexual psychopaths, bastards who pollute the world.","CN":"I know many Muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. You should not insult people based on their religion."}
{"HS":"Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents!","CN":"Fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from Islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it."}

{"HS":"Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.","CN":"Revenge is always wrong. Also it is not correct to generalize because the majority of Islamic terrorism victims are Muslims themselves."}
{"HS":"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!","CN":"I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes.
