Things I see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. To me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a European person or an immigrant. Also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality."
"English laws are against us, they support Muslims, and punish us for saying something bad about Muslims. Muslim rapists are everywhere, and the government let them in.","Actually, the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like PREVENT disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being Muslims.

"We see thousands of rapes, murders and subjugations on British girls every day. Muslims and non-British immigrants do such things.

Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics show that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here."
"We see thousands of rapes, murders and subjugations on British girls every day. Muslims and non-British immigrants do such things. But there will be consequences!",Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable.

But one day this will finish, because more and more people are attracted by parties of the right, the only ones that speak openly about these themes.","I think people are banned because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology."
"There are persons being banned for condemning Islam and his beliefs, terrorism and rape gangs. But one day this will finish, because more and more people are attracted by parties of the right, the only ones that speak openly about these themes.","It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promotes this view.

"Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books.","Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes."
"Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books.","How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context."

"Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books.",Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?

"The time to eliminate Islam has come, because it is a murderous cult.",Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?
"The time to eliminate Islam has come, because it is a murderous cult.",This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred.
"The time to eliminate Islam has come, because it is a murderous cult.",What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
"Islam controls people and does not permit anyone to express their imagination. This happens because all that Muslims need is their holy book, the Quran.","Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?"

"Islam is thinked to be a different culture, but actually is a cruelty, a group of beliefs similar to Nazism.",That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence.

"Some Muslims might not be involved in assaults but the basis of their religion is jihad, and they all support it. Islam in all its parts have Sharia law, and so all Muslims are extremists.","Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and living in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion."
"Some Muslims might not be involved in assaults but the basis of their religion is jihad, and they all support it. Islam in all its parts have Sharia law, and so all Muslims are extremists.","Don't most religions have instructions for what they deem to be 'righteous living', voluntary codes or laws (if you insist) for the faithful to follow.

Islam in all its parts have Sharia law, and so all Muslims are extremists.",Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!
"Some Muslims might not be involved in assaults but the basis of their religion is jihad, and they all support it. Islam in all its parts have Sharia law, and so all Muslims are extremists.","But like any religious concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'."

"A recent poll from yougov indicate that westeners do not consider Islam as good as other religions, and for this fact Islam is unsuitable with western values.","Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself.

"If the Koran was a current book, it would probably be prohibited as hate speech.",Is it the compulsory acts of charity?

"If the Koran was a current book, it would probably be prohibited as hate speech.","Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times."
"If the Koran was a current book, it would probably be prohibited as hate speech.",I think any book written that long ago probably would.
"If the Koran was a current book, it would probably be prohibited as hate speech.",In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others.
