fake	Alex Jones Vindicated in "Pizzagate" Controversy "Alex Jones, purveyor of the independent investigative news website Infowars and host of The Alex Jones Show, has been vindicated in his claims regarding the so-called "Pizzagate" controversy. Jones and others uncovered evidence last year that top Democratic Party officials were involved in a bizarre, satanic child sex cult and pornography ring using the Washington D.C. pizza parlor Comet Ping Pong Pizza as a front. The allegations rocked the Democratic Party and may have caused serious damage to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Top U.S. federal investigators have now confirmed that they have verified many of these claims after executing raids on the offices of several of the key players. Charges are expected to be filed in the coming days. The news comes as a welcome vindication for Jones, who has been accused by many mainstream media outlets of being a conspiracy theorist and of publishing "fake news". Mr. Jones has often drawn controversy, and was scapegoated in media reports as an example of how inaccurate and misleading news proliferated on social media websites like Facebook, Youtube and Twitter during the 2016 election. Jones has also exposed inconsistencies in the official government accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown Connecticut."

fake	Mexicans Are Chomping at the Bit to Stop NAFTA Renegotiation Meetings Mexico has been unfairly gaining from NAFTA as it stands now, placing profits derived from the measure as the main source of the country's economic growth.

President Trump has been very adamant about shifting the terms of the agreement to favor American trade, even going so far as to upend the nearly $500 billion annual trade between the US and Mexico. Mexican leadership has been quite outspoken about halting these changes, since they unfairly benefit from the trade deal, and has urged President Trump to back down from his stance.

fake	Superman to Not Appear in "Justice League" Movie When the new trailer for "Justice League" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the "Justice League" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning. Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that "It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him. "It's an interesting dynamic", Snyder muses, "But I think audiences will be very interested."

He tries to take all the time he can from playing the sport. Thus, a 24-pack of 12-ounce bottles is always adjacent to his locker.

fake	Wells Fargo Attempts To Gain Control Of Your Money -- Wells Fargo has begun to put into play it's plot to control consumer spending. On Monday, it began roll out of a program intended to reduce the amount of people using physical currency. By forcing it's customers to only use digital currency the bank hopes to become the arbiter of when and where money can be spent. Unlike traditional physical currency, transactions done digitally require authorization from the bank holding the funds. Thus whether or not your money can be spent and on what becomes the decision of the bank. But it isn't only Wells Fargo moving in this direction. The U.S. Government has long been pushing banks to move in this direction. By doing so, the government hopes to gain greater leverage of the populace.

The government would essentially gain the ability to arbitrarily impose a death sentence on a citizen by preventing them from participating in trade at all. Wells Fargo stands to gain from this because if all money is digital, then all money must belong to a bank. This is just the first step towards a more authoritarian American.

legit	German Power Spat With Denmark Holds Up Single Market Trade A long-running squabble between Denmark and Germany over power cables linking the countries has cut the amount of electricity Nordic producers can supply to Europe's biggest market to the lowest level in 17 years. Germany cut import capacity from mainland Denmark by 89 percent on average last year the most since a power market between the nations started in 2000. It's a consequence of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unprecedented Energiewende: the shift to wind and solar power mean surges in renewable energy production make it hard for the nation's grids to handle its own electricity let alone imports. The dispute is undermining the European Union's goal of breaking down national barriers for power to boost energy security and cut costs through more cross-border trading. Talks between Germany and Denmark have floundered with no resolution emerging from their latest meeting on the matter in Berlin last week.

legit	 This is how badly Saudi Arabia needs its big oil IPO to go well Saudi Arabia gave Saudi Aramco a huge gift this week by slashing the tax rate on the national oil company to 50% from 85%. The kingdom stressed that the drastically reduced tax rate which is retroactive to the start of 2017 would be offset by dividends and investment profits. The enormous tax relief will also add tens of billions of dollars to Aramco's coffers at a time of growing concern over how much the world's largest oil company is actually worth. While Saudi Arabia has said Aramco could be valued at $2 trillion in an expected 2018 IPO some analysts believed that price tag was too generous. Saudi Arabia badly needs the Aramco IPO to go smoothly because it would generate a cash windfall at a time when plunging oil revenue has blown a hole in its once-vaunted budget.

legit	Why Silicon Valley isn't fighting to save the Internet (yet) We thought we'd never have to pull this out again one member of the singing activist group said at a tech industry rally against President Trump in San Francisco earlier this month. Then the Grannies launched into their protest song: Say to Comcast to Verizon and to AT&T: Hands off the Internet it must be free." The chant stood out at the protest as the gathering mostly focused on Silicon Valley's fight with Trump over the travel ban. It also stands out as one of the few moments since Trump's inauguration when net neutrality took center stage in Silicon Valley. The net neutrality rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015 are intended to keep the Internet open and fair. The rules prevent Internet providers from playing favorites by deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps.

legit	Trump's Pick for Education Could Face Unusually Stiff Resistance Nominees for secretary of education have typically breezed through confirmation by the Senate with bipartisan approval. But Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump's choice for the post, is no typical nominee. She is a billionaire with a complex web of financial investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from the department she would oversee. She has been an aggressive force in politics for years, as a prominent Republican donor and as a supporter of steering public dollars to private schools. Her wealth and her politics seem likely to make her confirmation hearing unusually contentious, and possibly drawn out.

"When all is said and done," wrote Chief Justice John G.

legit	Even Preschoolers Face Racial Bias, Study Finds Racial bias against black students begins long before they get to their teens - it starts in preschool, according to a study released today from the Yale Child Study Center. The study was conducted as a two-part experiment: in the first part, educators watched black and white children together, and in the second, they read vignettes on misbehaving students. In each situation, they were asked to identify and rate bad behavior. The researchers showed 135 teachers a video of four children playing - a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl - and asked them to look for potentially problematic behavior. Here's the catch: there was no challenging behavior in any of the videos.

And the percentage who think so has grown. That's according to a new study out Wednesday from the Brookings Institution's Brown Center on Education Policy. Researcher Tom Loveless in 2001 surveyed foreign exchange students, then revisited the questions in 2016. He found that the new crop of students believe more strongly that school here is easier than in their native country - and that students here don't work as hard.

legit	Immigration Controversy Could Drive Up College Costs The University of Central Missouri is one of many higher-education institutions to express support for its Muslim students after President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Like many of the rest, it has reasons for feeling apprehensive that are not solely about empathy. The university hosted more than 3,700 international students last year, most of them paying full tuition that helps subsidize domestic students. Losing even a portion of those - something there are signs may already be starting to happen nationwide - would have a significant financial impact that could ultimately drive up costs for Americans.

legit	Scientists Bristle at Trump Budget's Cuts to Research Before he became president, Donald J. Trump called climate change a hoax, questioned the safety of vaccines and mocked renewable energy as a plaything of "tree-huggers." So perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Trump's first budget took direct aim at basic scientific and medical research. Still, the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early Thursday shocked scientists, researchers and program administrators. The reductions include $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases, and $900 million, or a little less than 20 percent, from the Department of Energy's Office of Science, which funds the national laboratories, considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world.

legit	How Companies and Colleges Can Get the U.S. Back to Work Last Friday, the Labor Department announced that the U.S. economy had enjoyed a record 76 consecutive months with job gains. Yet at the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that 5.6 million jobs remain unfilled because of a pernicious "skills gap" -- or mismatch between employers' needs and workers' abilities. In a Business Roundtable survey, 45 percent of C-suite executives say hiring is particularly difficult in so-called STEM fields, those requiring expertise in science, technology, engineering and math. College graduates themselves are no less concerned: A national survey commissioned by Northeastern University found that just 14 percent of recent college graduates believe their education prepared them to work with artificial intelligence and robotics -- innovations poised to transform the American workplace.
legit	School Choice Fails to Make a Difference This is the kind of news that school-choice advocates and skeptics alike need to pay attention to: The Economist magazine reports that a team of academic economists found that students who won a lottery in Louisiana to receive vouchers to go to the public or private school of their choice did worse than students who didn't win the lottery. This outcome flies in the face of the predictions of many economists, who often tout school choice as a way to improve the U.S. educational system while also increasing equality of opportunity. Economists typically assume that people are rational and well-informed, and will make decisions that benefit them. If giving students and their parents more school choice hurts the students academically, then something is seriously wrong with the theory.

legit	Sienna Miller on why her new role is not 'just a wife' If there's one thing Sienna Miller has in common with the character she plays in exploration epic Lost City of Z it's that she's not afraid to air her views loud and clear.

legit	 'Bates Motel' slashes into 'Psycho' in final season There's a fine line between creative risk-taking and sacrilege when dealing with well-known properties. While "Bates Motel" might not have committed the latter it has seemingly sacrificed the right to bill itself as a prequel to "Psycho." The A&E series always appeared to come with a built-in expiration date facing the danger of running out of real estate as it chewed through story related to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror classic. The contemporary setting also made the proceedings less spooky what with cellphones and other modern devices that alter the dynamics of say being alone in the basement with a murderer dressed like his mom. Still the announcement of a fifth and final season that would overlap with the movie actually created some excitement: after an ill-advised remake this offered an alternate window into the story including how these events unfolded from the perspective of Norman/Norma Bates.

Trump, who wore an "I Love Trucks" button on his lapel, tried his best to emulate a truck driver: He enthusiastically pumped his fists, made a series of facial expressions that lit up the Twittersphere, and excitedly tooted the big rig's horn at least six times.

Trump and Hillary Clinton collided in an almost unremittingly hostile debate on Sunday night, a 90-minute spectacle of character attacks, tawdry allegations, and Mr. Trump's startling accusation that Mrs. Clinton had "tremendous hate in her heart." In a remarkable political maneuver, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton had smeared women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexually assaulting or harassing them, seeking to salvage his presidential candidacy after explosive reports about his past lewd comments about women.

legit	Judge rejects Stein's request for hand recount in Wis. MADISON, Wis. - Green Party candidate Jill Stein paid $3.5 million Tuesday to clear the way for Wisconsin's presidential vote recount but had a judge reject her lawsuit to require all Wisconsin counties to do the recount by hand. Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn said the effort to force the hand recount, which was backed by Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign, did not meet the state's legal standard for prohibiting the use of machines in the recount, saying that the two campaigns did not show a hand recount, though more thorough, was necessary or show there was a clear and convincing evidence of fraud or other problems. Bailey-Rihn said there were good reasons to do a hand recount but no legal basis for her to mandate it.

legit	Back Channel to Trump: Loyal Aide in Trump Tower Acts as Gatekeeper In business, as a candidate and now as president, Mr. Trump has valued loyalty as the defining attribute in family, aides or Republicans in Congress. He does not always get it, as the defection of the Freedom Caucus last week on the health bill he was trying to pass made abundantly clear. But Mr. Trump can always count on Ms. Graff's allegiance, and that has made Ms. Graff, from her office in Trump Tower, a major figure in the operations of the White House for a simple reason: She is believed to have a direct line to the president. With her deep Queens accent and unerring deference to her boss (she has always referred to him as Mr. Trump or, usually, as Mr. T), Ms. Graff, 64, is a familiar voice to New York's business leaders, the nation's political reporters and now old associates hoping to circumvent the normal channels of communication to reach Mr. Trump.

Administration officials have drafted a new executive order aimed at overhauling, among other things, the H-1B work-visa program that technology companies have long relied on to bring top foreign engineering talent to their U.S.-based locations.

On the Republican's inauguration, the USTA's chief executive officer, Roger Dow, pledged the industry as a "capable, willing partner." But almost immediately things started to go sideways.

Two federal judges -- one in Maryland and one in Hawaii -- have blocked implementation of the core provisions of the travel ban, and it remains on hold nationwide. Drawing on a litany of then-candidate Donald Trump's statements about Muslims during the presidential campaign, both of the judges concluded that the new executive order likely violates the establishment clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. But Virginia-based US District Judge Anthony Trenga was not persuaded that Trump's past statements automatically mean the revised executive order is unlawful, especially given the changes it made from the first version.

And those sightings, captured via iPhone camera and shared on social media, have become fodder for regular coverage in traditional gossip columns, on friendly left-leaning blogs, and in fashion magazines eager to assess the president's post-White House wardrobe.

On a recent morning here in spring training before the start of his 12th full major league season he was talking about how at age 36 he will handle the rigors of chasing down balls in center field.

legit	The oldest Vespa in existence is up for auction If you dream of zipping around Rome on a classic Vespa like Audrey Hepburn, then listen up. The world's oldest Vespa is up for auction. The scooter is from Piaggio's "0 Series" with the serial number 1003, making it the third prototype of 60 made by the famous company. Because the first two have since gone to scooter heaven, 1003 is now the oldest Vespa. When the auction is over, the deep-pocketed owner won't win just a museum piece, because this Vespa still runs.
legit	Let there be light: German scientists test 'artificial sun' Scientists in Germany flipped the switch Thursday on what's being described as "the world's largest artificial sun," a device they hope will help shed light on new ways of making climate-friendly fuels. The giant honeycomb-like setup of 149 spotlights - officially known as "Synlight" - in Juelich, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Cologne, uses xenon short-arc lamps normally found in cinemas to simulate natural sunlight that's often in short supply in Germany at this time of year.
legit	No new threat led to airline laptop limits, officials say U.S. and British officials said Tuesday the decision to bar laptops and tablets from the cabins of some international flights wasn't based on any specific threat but on longstanding concerns about terrorists targeting jetliners. Unimpressed, some travelers and civil liberties groups denounced the ban, raising concerns that included lost worktime on long flights and worries that checking laptops in baggage will make them more vulnerable to theft. Under the new bans, electronic devices larger than smartphones, such as laptops, tablets and gaming devices, will have to be checked on some international flights. American officials announced the U.S. ban early Tuesday, and the British followed later in the day after discussions between the countries.
legit	Apple cuts prices on lower-end iPads, releases red iPhones Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn't materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases.
legit	Ban aimed at electronics in cabins of some US-bound flights The U.S. government is temporarily barring passengers on certain flights originating in eight other countries from bringing laptops, iPads, cameras and most other electronics in carry-on luggage starting Tuesday. The reason for the ban was not immediately clear. U.S. security officials would not comment. The ban was revealed Monday in statements from Royal Jordanian Airlines and the official news agency of Saudi Arabia. A second U.S. official said the ban will affect nine airlines in total, and the Transportation Security Administration will inform the affected airlines at 3 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.
legit	Yahoo Reveals Massive Breach of Data from 500M Accounts Popular web portal Yahoo said today that it believes a "state-sponsored actor" stole information relating to some 500 million user accounts from its network at the end of 2014. But Yahoo only learned about the breach "in the last few weeks," a source familiar with the matter told ABC News. The stolen information, according to Yahoo, could include names, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, password information, and possibly the question-answer combinations for security questions, which are often used to reset passwords.
legit	Phone device tests male fertility with 98% accuracy, study shows A new smartphone attachment can evaluate a man's semen and determine his level of fertility with up to 98% accuracy, a new study has showed. The new technology -- consisting of an external accessory in which sperm samples are inserted and an app that analyzes them -- could make testing as straightforward as a home pregnancy test, the scientists say. The new technology is still a few years away, but the team behind it hopes this new form of testing will make infertility testing both easier and cheaper for men, avoiding the need for them to go to a clinic.
legit	Wells Fargo introduces cardless ATMs across U.S. in digital push Starting on Monday, Wells Fargo & Co depositors can withdraw money using a smartphone at any branded ATM, the latest sign of U.S. lenders moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar banking. Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network.
legit	GPS device to prevent false Everest claims by climbers Nepal will provide GPS tracking devices to some mountaineers who attempt to scale Mount Everest this year to prevent them from making false summit claims and to track climbers in distress, an official said on Monday. Climbers who reach the 8,850-metre (29,035-feet) Everest summit must produce photographs showing them at the top as proof of their ascent, as well as a report from their liaison official who stays at base camp. The government banned an Indian couple from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years last year after they faked a photograph to show them atop the world's tallest peak.
legit	Following YouTube gaffe, AT&T, Verizon may pull most of their ads from Google After their ads appeared next to extremist content on YouTube, telecom companies AT&T and Verizon said they were going to pull their ads from the video site. But the fallout may go further than just YouTube. Google's Chief Business Officer Phillip Schindler issued an apology on the company's blog on Monday, saying the practice is unacceptable. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Schindler wrote in the blog statement.
legit	 Toyota teams up with Microsoft to bring voice recognition to cars Toyota owes Microsoft a big ol' "thank you" when it comes to the future of the automaker's connected cars. Microsoft will license a good deal of its connected car patents to Toyota, Automotive News reports. Toyota will have access to a number of intellectual properties covering operating systems, voice recognition, artificial intelligence and gesture control. It has not been disclosed how much money Toyota paid for this access, but it probably wasn't cheap.
legit	Amazon Prime Air drone completes its first US public delivery Amazon Prime Air said Thursday it shipped its first package out in public in the US this week, marking another small step toward its goal of filling the skies with delivery drones. The e-commerce giant's drone delivery arm has been testing flights for years, though due to federal regulations hasn't undertaken any US flights outside of its private land until now. On Monday, an autonomous drone delivered several bottles of sunscreen, about four pounds in all, to MARS 2017, an Amazon-hosted conference in Palm Springs, Florida. The entire flight took place in the controlled airspace of the Palm Springs Airport.
legit	Amazon has more budget phones to sell you Take a handful of budget phones. Cut their price even more. Voila -- you've got another hit on Amazon. The online retailer said Thursday that it's building on the popularity of its discounted phones program, called Prime Exclusive Phones, by adding two more devices to the lineup. Prime customers in the US can now preorder the Motorola Moto G5 Plus starting at $185, at least $45 below full retail price, or the Alcatel A30 for $60, at $40 off, Amazon said. These discounted prices, available only to Prime members, come thanks to ads Amazon slaps on the devices' lock screens.
legit	YouTube reverses some restrictions on gay-themed content The YouTube video shows two women, dressed in suits and ties. They smile; they sniffle back tears; they gaze into each other's eyes. They are reading their wedding vows to one another. The four-minute video titled "Her Vows" contains no nudity, violence or swearing. There's no revealing clothing. No one is engaging in activities that have a "high risk of injury or death." And yet, YouTube had deemed the video unsuitable for people under 18. YouTube acknowledged Monday that it might have made a mistake, saying in a tweet, "Some videos have been incorrectly labeled and that's not right. We're on it! More to come." The restriction on the vows video was lifted by Monday afternoon.
legit	Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Alphabet Inc's Google announced on Wednesday that it will revamp its popular maps app to allow users to share their locations, in order to boost engagement on a product of increasing strategic importance to the search giant. Within the next week, users worldwide will be able to share where they are in real time on devices running both Google's Android operating system and Apple Inc's iOS software, Google said. The feature is part of an array of new tools aimed at boosting the effectiveness of Google Maps, which analysts say is critical to the company's ambitions in commerce and transport. The location-sharing feature is aimed at helping people find each other in crowded places, such as concerts and conferences, and users will retain control over who they share their whereabouts with and for how long, said Google executive Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads Google Maps.
legit	Fruit-shaped sensor 'can improve freshness' A new fruit-shaped sensor could help cargo companies to keep fruit fresher in transit, researchers say. The device - which mimics the size, shape and composition of real fruit - is packed in with produce in transit and closely monitors its temperature. It comes in orange, apple, banana and mango varieties, and alerts firms to problems with their cooling processes, allowing them to take action. It could also lead to fresher fruit for consumers, researchers said. The project, which is still at the trial stage, is being conducted by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa).
legit	Twitter adds more anti-abuse tools Twitter has introduced more measures aimed at cutting down on the amount of abuse on the platform. Users will be able to limit what they see from certain types of account, particularly ones with no profile picture or information. Such accounts are often set up by trolls. The company said it would act only on accounts that its computer algorithms had thrown up as being abusive. "Since these tools are new, we will sometimes make mistakes, but know that we are actively working to improve and iterate on them every day," said Ed Ho, Twitter's vice-president of engineering in a blogpost.

legit	NASA test fires rocket engine for future Mars mission NASA tested part of the rocket that will likely take humans to Mars at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi on March 23. The engines will power the agency's new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on future deep space missions. This is the second RS-25 engine test for 2017 and the space agency has more planned. The engines will be part of the most powerful rocket in the world, according to NASA. Gary Benton, the product development manager for Stennis Space Center is in charge of testing of the rocket engines. "Those engines generate about 520,000 pounds of thrust each," Benton said, before the test fire of the engine.
legit	Samsung's new AI assistant will take on Siri and Alexa Samsung is preparing to launch a digital assistant called "Bixby," the latest product to result from the tech industry's obsession with artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Bixby will be featured on the new Galaxy S8, Samsung's head of research and development Injong Rhee said in a blog post. The S8 launches in New York next week. Samsung is banking on the S8 to help it recover from last year's embarrassing Note 7 debacle. The company killed off the flagship device after a recall and various fixes failed to stop some Note 7s from overheating and catching fire.
legit	Congress Moves to Strike Internet Privacy Rules From Obama Era WASHINGTON - Republican senators moved Thursday to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections for consumers in the first decisive strike against telecommunications and technology regulations created during the Obama administration, and a harbinger of further deregulation. The measure passed in a 50-to-48 vote largely along party lines. The House is expected to mirror the Senate's action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump. The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people's browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers.
legit	Machine Learning Opens Up New Ways to Help Disabled People CC rules require TV stations to provide closed captions that convey speech, sound effects, and audience reactions such as laughter to deaf and hard of hearing viewers. YouTube isn't subject to those rules, but thanks to Google's machine-learning technology, it now offers similar assistance. YouTube has used speech-to-text software to automatically caption speech in videos since 2009 (they are used 15 million times a day). Today it rolled out algorithms that indicate applause, laughter, and music in captions. More sounds could follow, since the underlying software can also identify noises like sighs, barks, and knocks.
legit	YouTube automates sound effect captions with AI YouTube has used algorithms to automatically caption speech for eight years now in an effort to make its billions of videos more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing. While the feature was pretty rough at first, it has significantly improved it over time, getting "closer and closer to human transcription error rates," Google said in its developers blog. Since speech is just one part of the audio picture, though, YouTube has launched automatic sound effect captioning for the first time. For now, the system can just show three classes of sounds: Applause, music and laughter.
legit	Solar-powered 'skin' could make prosthetics more real Many people try to stay out of the sun. But if a new type of solar-powered electronic skin makes its way onto prosthetics, wearers will definitely want those rays shining on their limbs. Researchers are already working to create smart skin that embeds sensors that mimic the tactile feedback of human skin, making it possible for amputees to feel pressure, temperature and even dampness. But how to power the futuristic material? A team from the University of Glasgow in the UK has come up with a version that harnesses the sun's rays. Because it produces its own energy from a natural source, the engineers say, the electronic skin would operate longer than similar materials powered by batteries or tethered to a power source that would also limit portability, clearly a key feature of any everyday prosthetic or touch-sensitive robot on the go.
legit	Uber Self-Driving Car Tests Resume Three Days After Crash Uber Technologies Inc.'s self-driving cars were back on public roads Monday, three days after a crash in Arizona put the company's testing program on hold. The ride-hailing company resumed testing in San Francisco Monday morning, and planned to restart the program in Tempe, Arizona, and Pittsburgh later in the day, according to an Uber spokeswoman. One of Uber's Volvo self-driving SUVs was involved in a high-impact crash on Friday in Tempe. The vehicle was not responsible for the incident and there were no injuries, Tempe police said. Another car failed to yield for the Uber car, causing the autonomous vehicle to flip on its side, according to the police report.
legit	Apple's Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life. Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks - which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 - have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers. Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and MacOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.
